### Email 1: Welcome to the Resistance
**Subject:** You have chosen to surf.
**Delay:** Immediate
**Content:**
> Hi [Name],
>
> Most people are ignoring the AI wave. They hope it goes away.
> By joining this list, you’ve made a different choice. You’ve chosen to **brace the impact.**
>
> **What to expect from Verduona:**
> We don't send "news." We send **intelligence**.
> Every week, you'll get:
> 1.  **One Workflow:** A specific, copy-pasteable AI pattern you can use.
> 2.  **One Reality Check:** Analysis of where the market is actually going (ignoring the hype).
> 3.  **One Tool:** A verified agent or utility that actually works.
>
> **Your First Mission:**
> Reply to this email with one word: **"Human"**.
> (This tells your email provider we aren't spam, and it tells me you're actually paying attention).
>
> Stand by.
> [Founder Name]

### Email 2: The Toy Phase is Over
**Subject:** Why ChatGPT isn't enough.
**Delay:** +2 Days
**Content:**
> [Name],
>
> Stop me if you've heard this one:
> *"I tried using AI to write a report, but it sounded like a robot, so I stopped."*
>
> That’s because you were treating it like a chatbot.
> In 2026, we don't chat. We **orchestrate**.
>
> **The Shift:**
> *   **Novice:** Asks one big question. Gets a mediocre answer.
> *   **Pro:** Assigns a Role. Decomposes the task. Assigns an Auditor.
>
> We call this the **"Lab by Kraliki"** method.
> It’s how we built our entire company infrastructure with a team of 3 people.
>
> Want the cheat sheet?
> Check out our **Become AI Competent** workshop. It includes the exact "System Prompts" we use daily.

**Subject:** Is your team (or child) safe?
**Delay:** +4 Days
**Content:**
> [Name],
>
> There is a risk we don't talk about enough. **Algorithmic Rot.**
> It happens when we outsource our *thinking*, not just our *doing*.
>
> Whether it's your marketing team asking AI to "write a strategy" or your child asking it to "write an essay," the result is the same: **Atrophy.**
>
> **The Antidote is Competence.**
> You must know *how* to do the work to effectively *manage* the AI doing it.
> A pilot doesn't let the autopilot fly into a mountain.
>
> If you're ready to take the controls:
