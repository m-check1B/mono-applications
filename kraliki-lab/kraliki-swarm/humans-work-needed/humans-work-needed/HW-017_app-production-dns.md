# HW-017: Point Production Domains for Kraliki Apps to Dev Server

**Created:** 2025-12-20
**Priority:** HIGH
**Status:** Pending
**Blocks:** Production access to Voice, Focus, Speak, Learn, Lab apps

## Context

Production domains need to be configured for the main applications. The Traefik routing is already configured and ready - just need DNS records pointed to the dev server.

**Server IP:** 5.9.38.218

## DNS Records Required

Add these A records in Cloudflare (or your DNS provider):

| Type | Name | Value | Proxy |
|------|------|-------|-------|
| A | voice | 5.9.38.218 | Proxied (orange cloud) |
| A | speak | 5.9.38.218 | Proxied (orange cloud) |
| A | focus | 5.9.38.218 | Proxied (orange cloud) |
| A | learn | 5.9.38.218 | Proxied (orange cloud) |
| A | lab | 5.9.38.218 | Proxied (orange cloud) |

**Full domains:**
- voice.kraliki.com - Voice by Kraliki
- speak.kraliki.com - Speak by Kraliki
- focus.kraliki.com - Focus by Kraliki
- learn.kraliki.com - Learn by Kraliki
- lab.kraliki.com - Lab by Kraliki

## Already Working (Beta Domains)

These are already live and working on verduona.dev:
- voice.verduona.dev
- speak.verduona.dev
- focus.verduona.dev
- learn.verduona.dev
- lab.verduona.dev

## Verification After DNS Setup

```bash
# Check DNS propagation
dig voice.kraliki.com +short
dig speak.kraliki.com +short
dig focus.kraliki.com +short
dig learn.kraliki.com +short
dig lab.kraliki.com +short

# Test HTTPS (after DNS propagation)
curl -I https://voice.kraliki.com
curl -I https://speak.kraliki.com
curl -I https://focus.kraliki.com
curl -I https://learn.kraliki.com
curl -I https://lab.kraliki.com
```

## Notes

- SSL certificates will be auto-generated by Let's Encrypt on first request
- First request may be slow due to cert generation
- Both beta (.verduona.dev) and production (.kraliki.com) domains will work
