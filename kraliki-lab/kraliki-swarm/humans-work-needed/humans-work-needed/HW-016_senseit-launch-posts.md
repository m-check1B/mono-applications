I just signed a contract.
It was 40 pages long.
I read it in 3 seconds.
How? 👇

We assume "reading" means moving your eyes left to right.
That's inefficient.
Reading is about extracting **meaning** and **risk**.
In 2026, reading is a job for Agents.

**Tweet 3/6**
I used SenseIt (@verduona bot).
I pointed my camera at the lease.
It didn't just OCR the text.
It found the semantic needles in the haystack.

🚩 Clause 4.2: "Rent increases by CPI + 5% annually." (Standard is CPI only).
🚩 Clause 12.1: "Tenant is responsible for structural roof repairs." (Illegal in residential).
🚩 Clause 15: "Landlord access with 2 hours notice." (Law requires 24h).

**Tweet 5/6**
It would have taken me 2 hours to find those.
And I'm not a lawyer.
SenseIt found them before the coffee cooled.

**Tweet 6/6**
