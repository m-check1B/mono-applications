**Headline:** Stop Prompting. Start Orchestrating.

Most teams are using AI like a collection of interns—chatting with them one by one, copy-pasting context, and hoping for the best.

That’s 2x productivity. Maybe.

We just measured our output using **Magic Box Pro**—our multi-agent orchestration environment.

**The Result?** 16x productivity.
We built infrastructure for 4 complete marketing sites in ~7 hours. A task that usually takes 6-8 hours *per site*.

**The Secret:**
It’s not about "better prompts." It’s about **Roles**.

In Magic Box Pro, you don't chat. You direct a squad:
1.  **Orchestrator (Claude):** Holds the context and plan.
2.  **Specialists (Gemini/Codex):** Execute code and design in parallel.
3.  **Auditor:** Verifies quality before you even see it.

Context isn't lost. It's managed.
Work isn't sequential. It's parallel.

We are opening up **Magic Box Pro** for early access.
This isn't just a tool; it's a pre-configured VM with our entire proven workflow installed.

Brace the impact. Or get buried by it.

**CTA:** DM me "ORCHESTRATE" to see the 4-hour build log.
