# HW-032: Mark Linear Issue VD-248 Done

## Why
Provisioning script updates are complete, but the feature verification requires the Linear issue state to be updated.

## Steps
1. Open Linear issue `VD-248` (Magic Box: Create automated provisioning script for VM setup).
2. Confirm the provisioning scripts exist and look correct:
   - `/home/adminmatej/github/applications/magic-box/scripts/provision.sh`
   - `/home/adminmatej/github/brain-2026/infra/bootstrap-magic-box.sh`
3. Move the issue to **Done**.
4. Reply back that the issue was marked Done.

## Notes
- The provisioning script keeps ports closed by default; open ports only with explicit approval.
