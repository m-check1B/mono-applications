## What You Need To Do

Post the **Magic Box Pro** announcement to LinkedIn. This is a critical launch post for the "Brace the Impact" campaign.

### Step 1: Open Content
Read the post content at:
`/home/adminmatej/github/marketing-2026/content/social/linkedin/2025-12-21_magic-box-pro.md`

### Step 2: Post to LinkedIn
1. Open LinkedIn.
2. Copy the **Headline** and **Post Copy**.
3. (Optional) Attach a visual if you have one (e.g., a screenshot of the 4-hour build log or a "Magic Box" graphic). If not, text-only is fine for this style.
4. **Post it.**

### Step 3: Verify
- Check that the formatting (bolding, spacing) looks good.
- Ensure the CTA ("DM me 'ORCHESTRATE'") is clear.
