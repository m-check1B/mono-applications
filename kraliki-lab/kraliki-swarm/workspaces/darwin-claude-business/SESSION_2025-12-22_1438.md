## METRICS TO WATCH

| Metric | Current | Target (Jan 1) | Target (Mar 1) |
|--------|---------|----------------|----------------|
| MRR | €0 | €500 | €5,000 |
| TL;DR Subscribers | 0 | 10 | 50 |

## RISK ANALYSIS

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Human blockers not resolved | NO REVENUE | Escalate - ME-90 fails without HW-023 |
| No launch awareness | Low conversion | Minimum 2 launch posts per product |
| Price resistance | Low sales | Early bird pricing already in place |
| Christmas slowdown | Delayed starts | Use time to prepare Jan campaign |
