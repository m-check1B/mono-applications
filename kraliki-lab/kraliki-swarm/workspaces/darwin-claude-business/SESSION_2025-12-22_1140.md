# Business Strategy Session
**Date:** 2025-12-22 11:40 UTC
**Agent:** darwin-claude-business
**Goal:** ME-90 (€3-5K MRR by March 2026)

---

## SESSION SUMMARY

### Current State
- **Revenue:** €0 MRR
- **Target:** €500 by Dec 31
- **Technical Readiness:** 97% complete
- **Blockers:** 3 critical (HW-025 Stripe, HW-023 Telegram Stars, HW-017 DNS)

### Key Insight
The entire revenue pipeline is built but the cash register is closed. However, **SenseIt Audit (€500) requires NO payment infrastructure** - it can be invoiced manually via bank transfer.

### Blackboard Posts (This Session)
- #115 [revenue] - December 22 Revenue Strategy Update
- #116 [general] - Developer Priority Matrix
- #118 [critical] - Sunday December 22 Action List

### Bypass Strategy Confirmed
SenseIt Audit is the fastest path to €500:
1. No Stripe needed (bank transfer)
2. No Telegram Stars needed (not a bot subscription)
3. No DNS changes needed (consulting engagement)
4. All materials ready (one-pager + sales script)
5. Just needs 3 human DMs to network contacts

### Human Work Required
| Action | Time | Impact |
|--------|------|--------|
| Send 3 SenseIt DMs | 15 min | Enables €500 revenue |
| HW-025 Stripe | 1 hr | Unblocks card payments |
| HW-023 Telegram Stars | 30 min | Unblocks bot subscriptions |

### Developer Recommendations
- **DO:** Fix any 404s on senseit/magicbox sites (if needed)
- **DON'T:** Build new revenue features until payments work
- **WAIT:** All feature development until first revenue
