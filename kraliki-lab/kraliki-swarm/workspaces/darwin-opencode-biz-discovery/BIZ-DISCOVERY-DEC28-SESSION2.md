## NEW Opportunities (5)

### 1. AI Cost Optimization Services
**Opportunity:** Help businesses reduce AI token costs and compute expenses by 30-50%

**Market Pain Point:** Companies adopting AI are experiencing unexpected high costs from LLM API usage (OpenAI, Anthropic, Claude). Token costs can reach €50K-500K/month for mid-sized companies. Most lack visibility into spend and optimization strategies.

**Services:**
- AI Cost Audit (€3K-8K) - analyze current AI spend, identify waste, recommend optimizations
- Cost Optimization Implementation (€10K-25K) - implement caching, model switching, prompt engineering, RAG to reduce costs
- Monthly Cost Monitoring (€1K-2K/month) - track spend, alert on anomalies, continuous optimization

**Optimization Framework:**
- Token Usage Analysis (identify expensive prompts, high-volume use cases)
- Model Selection Strategy (use smaller models where possible, only premium for complex tasks)
- Caching & Memoization (avoid redundant API calls)
- Prompt Engineering Optimization (reduce tokens while maintaining quality)
- RAG Implementation (reduce context window usage)
- Batch Processing (reduce per-request overhead)

**Use Cases:**
- Customer service chatbots
- Content generation workflows
- Data analysis pipelines
- Internal AI assistants
- AI-powered search

**Target:**
- SaaS companies with AI features
- E-commerce platforms
- Media companies (content generation)
- Fintech companies
- Mid-sized enterprises with AI initiatives

**Revenue Potential:** €85,000 by Q4 2026
**Competition:** Low (most AI consultancies focus on implementation, not cost optimization)
**Next Steps:** Create AI Cost Calculator tool, build case study from internal optimization work

### 2. AI Quality Assurance & Testing Automation
**Opportunity:** Provide comprehensive QA services for AI systems to ensure accuracy, reliability, and lack of bias

**Market Pain Point:** Companies deploying AI struggle to ensure quality. Traditional QA doesn't work for AI systems (non-deterministic outputs, edge cases, bias risks). Regulatory requirements (EU AI Act) require systematic testing.

**Services:**
- AI Quality Assessment (€5K-15K) - evaluate AI system accuracy, bias detection, edge case analysis, robustness testing
- Automated Test Suite Development (€15K-35K) - build AI-specific testing infrastructure, create test datasets, implement monitoring
- Monthly QA Service (€2K-5K/month) - continuous testing, regression testing, new scenario coverage

**Testing Framework:**
- Accuracy Testing (measure against ground truth, calculate metrics)
- Bias & Fairness Analysis (test across demographics, identify discriminatory patterns)
- Edge Case Discovery (stress test with unusual inputs)
- Robustness Testing (input perturbations, adversarial examples)
- Consistency Testing (run same prompt multiple times, check for consistency)
- Performance Benchmarking (latency, throughput, cost per query)

**Use Cases:**
- Customer service AI
- Content recommendation systems
- Hiring/HR AI systems
- Medical diagnosis AI
- Financial decision AI
- Content moderation systems

**Target:**
- AI startups deploying products
- Enterprises with AI in production
- Regulated industries (healthcare, finance, HR)

- AI Knowledge Base Implementation (€20K-50K) - build vector database, implement RAG, integrate with existing tools (Slack, Teams, Notion)
- Monthly Knowledge Optimization (€2K-4K/month) - update content, improve retrieval accuracy, user training

**Framework:**
- Knowledge Ingestion (documents, emails, wikis, code, databases)
- Vector Embedding & Storage (Qdrant, Pinecone, Weaviate)
- Semantic Search (RAG, hybrid search, reranking)
- Access Control (ensure AI respects permissions)
- Continuous Learning (feedback loops to improve results)
- Analytics (search patterns, knowledge gaps)

**Use Cases:**
- Employee onboarding & documentation
- Sales & customer support knowledge
- Technical documentation search
- R&D knowledge sharing
- Policy & procedure access
- Expert finder (connect people with knowledge)

**Target:**

### 4. AI Regulatory Compliance Audits (EU AI Act)
**Opportunity:** Help companies comply with emerging AI regulations (EU AI Act, GDPR, CCPA)

**Market Pain Point:** EU AI Act (enforced 2026) classifies AI systems by risk (Unacceptable, High, Limited, Minimal). Non-compliance risks fines up to 6% of global turnover. Companies are unprepared.

**Services:**
- AI Risk Assessment (€8K-20K) - classify AI systems, identify risk category, assess compliance gaps
- Compliance Implementation (€25K-60K) - implement required controls, documentation, technical measures
- Ongoing Compliance Support (€3K-6K/month) - monitoring, audit preparation, regulation updates

**Compliance Framework (EU AI Act):**
- Risk Classification (Unacceptable/High/Limited/Minimal)
- High-Risk Requirements:
  - Risk management system
  - Data governance (quality, bias, transparency)
  - Technical documentation
  - Record keeping
  - Transparency & provision of information
