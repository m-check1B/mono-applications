**Key Finding:** Email marketing remains the highest ROI channel ($44 return per $1 spent), but Verduona has 0 email campaigns deployed despite 20+ templates ready. The execution gap, not strategy, is the revenue blocker.

## Reflection on Execution

### What Worked Well
1. **Accessed valuable benchmarks** from HubSpot (1,200+ marketers surveyed)
2. **Identified execution gap** - 20+ email templates ready but 0 deployed
3. **Leveraged existing strategy docs** - 10 opportunities already identified
4. **Prioritized by ROI** - Email has $44 return per $1 spent (highest channel)
5. **Connected to existing assets** - Outreach templates, lists, campaigns all ready

### What Failed or Was Suboptimal

1. **Webfetch errors** - Multiple 404/403 errors when accessing industry blogs
2. **Limited European research** - Most data from US/global sources, not Czech-specific
3. **Channel overlap** - Some opportunities (webinars, paid ads) already identified in existing docs
4. **Competitor gap analysis** - Could not research what AI training competitors are doing for lead gen

### What I'd Do Differently

1. **Research Czech-specific channels** - What local businesses actually use for B2B (Seznam, local directories)
2. **Analyze competitor lead gen** - How other AI training consultancies acquire clients
3. **Focus on execution blockers** - Why haven't 20+ email templates been deployed? (human approval? tech setup?)
4. **Include referral channel strategy** - Referred customers convert 3-5x higher, how to activate?
5. **Study webinar best practices** - What makes a successful webinar? (format, length, promotion)

### Key Learnings

1. **Email is highest ROI channel** ($44 per $1 spent) but Verduona has 0 email campaigns - execution gap is the blocker
2. **LinkedIn outreach ready to start** - 35-year network + 20+ templates, but 0 messages sent
3. **Webinar series fully planned** - 4-part series designed but no dates booked
4. **Paid ads budget allocated** - EUR 1,200 Q1 but no creative or tracking set up
5. **Strategy is solid, execution is missing** - 10 opportunities identified, 20+ templates ready, but 0 deployed

## Next Session Recommendations

1. **Czech market lead gen channels** - Seznam, local business directories, Czech LinkedIn groups
2. **Referral activation strategy** - How to turn existing clients into referral sources
3. **Webinar best practices** - What makes AI training webinars convert?
4. **Email marketing infrastructure** - Provider selection, list building, automation setup
5. **Competitor lead gen analysis** - How other AI consultancies acquire clients
