## SALES PROCESS FOR SENSE AUDIT (€500)

### Flow
Booking Call → Discovery (30min) → Proposal → Close

### Script Framework

**DISCOVERY CALL (30 min)**
```
Goal: Validate fit, identify pain, pitch audit

1. Open & Build Rapport (2 min)
   "Thanks for booking. Before we dive in, tell me about your role and company."
   
2. Company Overview (3 min)
   "Help me understand: team size, what you do, who you serve."
   
3. Current AI Reality (5 min)
   "Walk me through: What AI tools are you using? Who's using them? What results?"
   
4. Pain Exploration (5 min)
   "What's NOT working with AI today?"
   - Tool bloat?
   - Low adoption?
   - No ROI visibility?
   - Security concerns?
   - Compliance issues?
   
5. Goals (3 min)
   "If AI was working perfectly for you 6 months from now, what does that look like?"
   
6. Stakeholders (2 min)
   "Who else needs to be involved in this decision?"
   
7. Pitch Audit (5 min)
   "Based on what you shared, you'd benefit from our Reality Check Audit. We'll:
   - Review your current AI stack
   - Identify immediate savings (usually 20-40%)
   - Spot security/compliance gaps
   - Create 90-day action plan
   - Cost: €500, ROI: typically 5-10x
   Takes 3 days, deliverable: 15-page report + 1-hour walkthrough
   
8. Next Steps (3 min)
   "If we find clear ROI opportunities, we'll discuss AI Training Retainer (€3K/mo)
    to implement the plan. No pressure - audit value stands alone."
   
9. Objection Handling (2 min)
   OBJECTION: "€500 is expensive"
   RESPONSE: "Most clients save 20-40% on AI tools within 30 days. If we don't find
    €2K+ in savings, we refund the audit. Zero risk."
    
   OBJECTION: "We'll do it internally"
   RESPONSE: "Most teams try internally. Problem: You're too close to it. We've
    audited 50+ companies - we know what good looks like. Also takes your team
    20+ hours; our audit takes 3 days of specialized work."
    
   OBJECTION: "Let me think about it"
   RESPONSE: "Totally understand. Audit slots: 2 this week, 3 next week. If you
    want one, let's pick a day now. If not, no pressure - reach out when ready."
    
10. Close (5 min)
    "Ready to move forward? We need 3 things:
    - 2-3 stakeholders on audit kickoff call (30 min)
    - Access to your AI tool dashboards
    - Payment via Stripe link I'll send (or bank transfer if preferred)
    What day works for kickoff?"

## SALES PROCESS FOR QUARTERLY AI REVIEW (€1.5K-3K)

### Flow
Audit Client → Upsell During Walkthrough → Propose Quarterly → Close

### Script Framework

**DURING AUDIT WALKTHROUGH (15 min)**
```
Goal: Transition one-time audit → recurring quarterly reviews

1. Deliver Findings (10 min)
   Present audit report, highlight savings, security gaps, action plan.

2. Transition Pitch (2 min)
   "This audit gives you a snapshot. The problem: AI changes FAST. New tools,
    pricing changes, security updates - you can't stay on top of everything.
    
   That's why we offer Quarterly AI Reviews. Every 90 days, we:
   - Re-audit your AI stack (new tools, pricing, security)
   - Track progress on action plan
   - Update roadmap based on what's changed
   - Identify new savings opportunities
   
   Most clients save an additional 15-25% per quarter."

3. Pricing (1 min)
   "Quarterly Review: €1.5K-3K depending on complexity.
    4x/year = €6K-12K/year
    ROI: 2-3x via ongoing savings + strategic guidance"
   
4. Scarcity (1 min)
   "We work with 10 quarterly clients max. Currently have [X] spots.
    Want to reserve one?"
   
5. Objection Handling
   OBJECTION: "Too expensive"
   RESPONSE: "Most clients save €2-4K/quarter from the review itself. Plus you
    avoid security incidents, compliance issues, missed opportunities. What's
    the cost of NOT having this?"
    
   OBJECTION: "We'll just do annual review"
   RESPONSE: "AI changes quarterly, not annually. Pricing changes happen every
    few months. Security threats emerge weekly. Quarterly is minimum to stay
    ahead."
    
   OBJECTION: "Let's see how this audit goes first"
   RESPONSE: "Smart. Audit deliverable is in 3 days. After walkthrough, if
    you're seeing value, we can discuss quarterly then. If not, no pressure."
```

**QUARTERLY REVIEW AGREEMENT (Send if interested)**
```
Subject: Quarterly AI Review Agreement - [Company Name]

    Investment: €4K/month
    Net ROI: €3,200/month"

4. Scarcity (1 min)
   "We work with 5 retainer clients max. Currently have [X] spots.
    This is our highest-touch service."

5. Next Steps (5 min)
   "This is a bigger commitment. Let's do a deeper discovery call:
   - Your team's current AI skills
   - What you want to achieve in 6/12 months
   - Budget considerations

   Then I'll create a custom proposal.

## OBJECTION HANDLING FRAMEWORK

### Common Objections by Offer

**Audit (€500)**
- "Too expensive" → ROI guarantee (5-10x)
- "We'll do it internally" → 20+ hours vs 3 days of specialized work
- "Send info first" → "Sure, but audit slots fill. Book now, cancel free."
- "Not a priority" → "What's priority? If saving €2K+ isn't, what is?"

**Quarterly (€1.5-3K)**
- "Too expensive" → ROI 2-3x, cost of NOT doing it (security, compliance)
- "We'll do annual" → AI changes quarterly, not annually
- "Let's see how this goes" → Smart, but quarterly spots limited
- "We have internal team" → External perspective + specialized expertise

**Retainer (€3-5K/mo)**
- "Too expensive" → ROI 2-4x, cost of NOT training (lost productivity)
- "We'll do it internally" → External expertise + faster time-to-value
- "Let's start smaller" → "We can do 3-month pilot (€12K), then extend"
- "Not in budget" → "What IS in budget? Can we design program to fit?"
