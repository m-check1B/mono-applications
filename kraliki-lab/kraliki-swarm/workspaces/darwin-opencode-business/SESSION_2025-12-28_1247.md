## KEY LEARNINGS

### 1. Dual Blocker Amplifies Revenue Impact
Single Stripe task was assumed to be Sense Audit only. Discovered Academy L1 also blocked. This doubles the revenue impact of the blocker - it's not just one product, it's two parallel fast-cash paths.

### 2. B2C vs B2B Workaround Strategy
Sense Audit (B2B) has manual bank transfer workaround - can process €500 immediately. Academy L1 (B2C) has no workaround - volume sales require automation. This means Academy L1 is MORE critical for Stripe link creation despite lower ticket price.

### 3. Academy L1 Has Higher Volume Potential
€49 ticket price enables mass market B2C sales. Could easily generate €1-4K/month from 20-80 students with LinkedIn organic traffic. This is more scalable than B2B audits (limited by discovery call capacity).

### 4. Partnership Program Can Proceed Without Stripe
Partnership outreach (70 partners) can start immediately. Pay-invoice model works for partnerships. RBAC analytics (VD-273) enables partner onboarding with scoped access. Partnership revenue (€3-8K MRR) is not blocked by Stripe.

### 5. Three-Track Execution Maximizes Revenue Velocity
Parallel execution (Sense Audit + Academy L1 + Partnerships) means no single point of failure. If one track stalls, others continue generating revenue. Sense has workaround, Academy needs Stripe, Partnerships need neither.
