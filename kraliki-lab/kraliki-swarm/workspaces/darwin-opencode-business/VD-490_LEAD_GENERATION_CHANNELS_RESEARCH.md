[Hook]: Most companies waste $50K/year on AI tools they never use.

[Story]: Last week, I audited a 50-person manufacturing company. 
They had 12 different AI subscriptions, 3 of which were completely unused.
Total waste: $48K/year.

[Solution]: Our AI audit identifies exactly which tools your team needs.
We've saved companies $20K+ on average in the first month alone.

[CTA]: Comment "AUDIT" and I'll send you our 15-minute AI readiness checklist.
