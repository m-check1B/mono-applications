# Referral Program Strategy
**Date:** 2025-12-28
**Agent:** darwin-opencode-business
**Task:** Design referral program to accelerate revenue growth

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Referrals are the fastest path to revenue. Conversion rate: 30-50% vs 5-10% for cold leads. Closing time: 50% shorter. Designed referral program to leverage early clients for exponential growth. Target: 2-3 referrals/month = €1.5K-7.5K MRR by March 2026.

---

## REFERRAL ECONOMICS

### Why Referrals Work
- **High conversion:** 30-50% vs 5-10% cold (5-10x better)
- **Fast closing:** 7-14 days vs 30-90 days cold (3-6x faster)
- **Low CAC:** €0-50 vs €200-500 cold (90%+ savings)
- **High trust:** Social proof from peer recommendation
- **High LTV:** Referred clients stay 2-3x longer
- **Higher spend:** 20-30% more than non-referred clients

### Revenue Impact
**Base Case:**
- 2 audit clients/month → 2 referrals
- 30% conversion → 0.6 new clients
- 50% audit-to-retainer upsell → 0.3 retainers
- Revenue: €900/month (€900 from audits + €900 from retainer MRR)

**Growth Case:**
- 5 audit clients/month → 5 referrals
- 30% conversion → 1.5 new clients
- 50% audit-to-retainer upsell → 0.75 retainers
- Revenue: €2,250/month (€750 from audits + €1,500 from retainer MRR)

**Exponential Case (Network Effect):**
- Each client refers 1-2 clients over 6 months
- 10 initial clients → 30-40 total in 6 months
- Revenue: €3K-5K MRR (ACHIEVES TARGET)

## REFERRAL PROGRAM STRUCTURE

### Two-Tier System

#### TIER 1: INTRODUCER REWARD
**For:** Any person who introduces a qualified lead
**Reward:** €50-€100 per qualified introduction
**Definition of qualified:**
- Company size: 20-500 employees
- Decision maker: CEO/CTO/COO/HR Director
- Industry: SaaS, Manufacturing, Services, Healthcare
- Geography: EU (Czech/Poland: 25% discount opportunity)
**Payment:** Within 7 days of introduction (no deal required)

**How it works:**
1. Introducer sends email introduction: "Meet [Name], CEO of [Company]. They need AI help."
2. We respond within 24 hours
3. We qualify the lead (15-min call)
4. If qualified, we pay €50-€100 to introducer

**Script for introducers:**
```
Hi [Contact],

I want to introduce you to [Founder Name] at Verduona. They do AI audits and training for companies like yours.

They've helped companies save 20-40% on AI costs within 30 days.

Worth a 30-min chat? I'll copy them here.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

#### TIER 2: SUCCESS REWARD
**For:** Any person who refers a client who closes a deal
**Reward:** 10% of first-year contract value

**Reward table:**
| Deal Type | Deal Value | Your Reward |
|-----------|------------|-------------|
| Audit | €500 | €50 |
| Quarterly Review | €2K/quarter × 4 = €8K/year | €800 |
| Training Retainer | €4K/month × 12 = €48K/year | €4,800 |
| Pilot Project | €5K | €500 |

**How it works:**
1. You introduce us to a prospect (or they mention you referred them)
2. We close the deal (audit, quarterly, retainer, or pilot)
3. We pay you 10% of first-year contract value within 14 days

**Payment terms:**
- Audit: Pay after full payment received
- Quarterly: Pay after first quarter payment received (€500)
- Retainer: Pay after first 3 months paid (€1,200 of €4,800)
- Pilot: Pay after full project payment received

## REFERRAL SOURCES

### 1. PAST CLIENTS
**Target:** Any company/individual who worked with Verduona
**Approach:** Email + phone call
**Timing:** 30 days after project completion
**Incentive:** 10% success reward

**Script:**
```
Subject: Quick favor, huge thank you 🙏

Hi [Name],

Hope AI is working great for your team!

I'm reaching out with a quick favor. We're looking to work with more companies like yours.

Do you know anyone in your network who might benefit from our AI audit or training?

If you introduce us and they become a client, I'll send you 10% of their first-year contract value as a thank you.

Example: If they sign a €48K retainer, you get €4,800.

No pressure - just wanted to open the door.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### 2. CURRENT CLIENTS
**Target:** Active audit/quarterly/retainer clients
**Approach:** During project execution
**Timing:** After early wins (savings identified, workshop completed)
**Incentive:** 10% success reward

**During audit delivery:**
"As we wrap up this audit, I want to ask: Who else in your network would benefit from this? If you introduce us and they become a client, you'll get 10% of their first-year contract. Think about it."

**During retainer delivery:**
"How are you feeling about the training so far? [Pause for feedback]. Great. Listen, if you know other companies struggling with AI, refer them and you'll earn 10% of their first year with us. No pressure, just wanted you to know."

### 3. PARTNERS & COLLABORATORS
**Target:** Other consultants, agencies, freelancers who serve same market
**Approach:** Partnership proposal
**Timing:** Ongoing
**Incentive:** 10% success reward + cross-referral opportunity

**Partnership proposal:**
```
Subject: Partnership opportunity for [Partner Company]

Hi [Name],

I've been following your work with [their clients]. Impressive.

I'm building Verduona - AI audits and training for mid-market companies.

I see a partnership opportunity: You refer clients who need AI help → We do the work → You get 10% of first-year contract value.

I'll also refer clients back to you for [their services] (web design, marketing, operations, etc.).

### 5. INTRODUCER NETWORK
**Target:** People who are connectors, not necessarily potential clients
**Approach:** Position them as "paid introducers"

**For Success Rewards (10% of deal):**
1. **Referrer** introduces prospect OR prospect mentions referrer
2. **We** record referrer in CRM
3. **We** close deal with prospect

**Option 2: CRM custom field**
Add "Referral Source" field to Contact/Deal objects

## REFERRAL PROGRAM EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Past Client Referral

**Situation:** Did audit for Company A (50 employees, saved them €2K/month)

**30 days later:** Send referral email to CEO of Company A

**CEO responds:** "Sure, my friend runs Company B (80 employees)"

**Introduction:** CEO A introduces us to CEO B via email

**We qualify:** Company B needs help with AI training (not audit)

**We pitch:** AI Training Retainer @ €4K/month

**Deal closes:** Company B signs 12-month retainer (€48K/year)

**Reward:** CEO A gets 10% = €4,800

**Revenue:** €4,000/month MRR from Company B

**ROI:** €4,800 reward for €48K deal = 10x

### Example 2: Partner Referral

**Situation:** Partner with Marketing Agency X (serves 50+ clients)

**We propose:** "Refer clients for AI work, get 10%. We'll refer back for marketing projects."

**Agency X refers:** Client Y (needs AI content automation)

**We close:** Audit €500, then upsell to retainer €3K/month

**Reward:** Agency X gets 10% of €500 (audit) + 10% of €36K/year (retainer) = €3,700

**Revenue:** €3,000/month MRR from Client Y

**Cross-referral:** We refer Agency X to Client Z for marketing project (Agency earns €5K)

**Mutual benefit:** Both companies grow revenue

### Example 3: Introducer Referral

**Situation:** Investor friend knows 20+ portfolio companies

**We propose:** "Introduce us to your portfolio companies. €50 per qualified intro, no sales needed."

**Investor refers:** 5 companies in one week

**We qualify:** 3 are qualified (right size, right industry)

**We pay:** Investor gets €50 × 3 = €150

**We close:** 1 out of 3 (30% conversion) → €48K retainer

**ROI:** €150 reward for €48K deal = 320x

**Investor happy:** Easy money for warm introductions

✅ Give updates ("Just closed a deal from your referral!")
