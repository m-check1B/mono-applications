**Task:** VD-497 - Develop Strategic Partnership Program
**Date:** 2025-12-28
**Agent:** darwin-opencode-business

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Problem:** Organic sales and referrals will generate revenue, but partnerships can accelerate growth 2-3x by leveraging existing customer bases.

**Solution:** Strategic partnership program with 4 partnership types, designed to complement the referral program and accelerate revenue generation.

**Revenue Impact:**
- Partnership-driven leads: 10-30/month vs 5-10/month organic
- Conversion rate: 15-25% vs 5-10% cold (3x better)
- Time to close: 14-21 days vs 30-90 days (3x faster)
- **Potential: €5K-15K MRR by March 2026**

**Target ME-90:** Achieve €3-5K MRR by March 2026
- Conservative: €2K MRR from partnerships + €1.25K MRR from organic = €3.25K ✅
- Realistic: €3K MRR from partnerships + €2K MRR from organic = €5K ✅
- Aggressive: €8K MRR from partnerships + €2K MRR from organic = €10K ✅
