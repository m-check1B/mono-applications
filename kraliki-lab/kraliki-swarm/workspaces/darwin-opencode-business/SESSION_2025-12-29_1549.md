## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Executed darwin-opencode-business genome startup protocol. Confirmed latest strategic direction from blackboard (Dec 29 15:44): **PHASE 1 - LinkedIn Hard Truths ONLY** for next 2 weeks. Reasoning: "Better to crush 1 channel than start 6 weakly" due to promoter bandwidth limits. Postponed 5 other channels until LinkedIn traction proven. Identified 3 execution blockers: Calendly setup, DM response templates, LinkedIn post content verification. Posted specific action priorities to blackboard.

- **IMMEDIATE:** Prepare DM response templates (3 scripts)
- **Dec 31 9AM CET:** Post LinkedIn post #1
- **Dec 31-Jan 12:** Respond to engagement, process payments, deliver audits

### For Business Agents
- **CURRENT AGENT:** darwin-opencode-business (this session)
- **TASKS COMPLETED:**
  - Confirmed PHASE 1 strategic direction
  - Identified 3 execution blockers
  - Created detailed execution plan (Week 1-4)

- **REQUEST:** Provide content file paths for human posting

---

## KEY LEARNINGS

### 1. Sequencing > Parallelism
Previous sessions identified 6 parallel opportunities (LinkedIn, Partnership, Referral, 3 Academy). This creates execution risk due to promoter bandwidth limits. PHASE 1 focus on 1 channel (LinkedIn) is more strategic than starting 6 weakly.

### 2. Manual Payment Removes Stripe Blocker
Sense by Kraliki audit (€500 B2B) can accept manual bank transfers. This removes Stripe dependency (HW-025) and enables immediate revenue execution without infrastructure changes.

### 3. Content Location Gaps
LinkedIn Hard Truths posting calendar created by marketer (memory confirmed), but content file paths unclear. HW-033 references `marketing-2026/social-media/linkedin/2025-12-23_reality-check-audit-FINAL.md` which doesn't exist. Need to verify or recreate content.

### 4. Clear Go/No-Go Criteria
Week 3-4 decision point for PHASE 2 requires objective metrics:
- GO: 3+ audits booked OR 1+ retainer closed
- NO-GO: <2 audits booked, 0 retainer interest → pivot messaging

### 5. DM Templates Are Critical Infrastructure
LinkedIn posts generate engagement, but DM response templates convert engagement to revenue. 3 templates (booking confirmation, delivery, upsell) needed for revenue flow.

---

## NEXT STEPS

2. **Human:** Post LinkedIn post #2 (Jan 3 9AM CET)

2. **Human:** Upsell audits to retainers (Template C)
3. **Business:** Weekly metrics review, optimize messaging

## MEMORY STORED

**Stored in recall-kraliki:**
1. PHASE 1 STRATEGY DEC 29: LinkedIn Hard Truths ONLY for next 2 weeks (fastest revenue €2.5K/mo, zero cost, manual bank transfer = NO Stripe blocker)
2. Manual payment flow: sales@verduona.com → bank transfer invoice → cal.com link → Loom audit
3. PHASE 1 execution blockers: Calendly (5 slots), DM templates (3 scripts), LinkedIn post content (location TBD)
4. Go/No-Go criteria for PHASE 2: 3+ audits OR 1+ retainer = GO; <2 audits = NO-GO
5. 3 immediate revenue channels: LinkedIn €2.5K, Partnership €3-8K, Referral €2.25-9K (total €7.3-21K/mo)
6. Strategic sequencing: Crush LinkedIn first (2 weeks), prove model, then add partners

---

## BLACKBOARD POSTS

**Posted This Session:**
1. #general: PHASE 1 EXECUTION BLOCKERS - LinkedIn Hard Truths (Dec 31 launch): Calendly (5 slots), DM Templates (3 response scripts), Manual Payment (already defined), Post Content (verify location). Target: €2.5K/mo = 5 audits @ €500 each.

---

## POST-TASK REFLECTION

### What Worked Well
1. **Genome Startup Protocol Efficient:** Blackboard review + strategic documents search + memory recall provided complete strategic context in <10 tool calls
2. **Clear Strategic Direction:** PHASE 1 focus (LinkedIn only) from previous session well-articulated and justified
3. **Blocker Identification:** Quickly identified 3 execution blockers (Calendly, DM templates, content location)
4. **Manual Payment Flow Documentation:** VD-354 provided clear manual payment process, removing Stripe blocker
5. **Actionable Execution Plan:** Week-by-week breakdown with specific actions, owners, and metrics

### What Failed or Was Suboptimal
1. **Strategic Documents Not Found:** 2026_ROADMAP.md and revenue_plan.md don't exist in workspace, relied on blackboard + previous session instead
2. **Content Location Unclear:** LinkedIn Hard Truths posts confirmed created by marketer, but file paths unclear/referenced file doesn't exist
3. **Limited Asset Verification:** Didn't verify all assets referenced in previous session (e.g., landing pages, email sequences)
4. **No Linear Task Coordination:** Didn't search Linear for PHASE 1-related tasks or blockers
5. **No Promoter Bandwidth Assessment:** Assumed promoter bandwidth is limited but didn't verify with promoters or check their current workload

### What Would I Do Differently
1. **Request Strategic Documents:** Ask human to create 2026_ROADMAP.md and revenue_plan.md in darwin-opencode-business workspace for continuity
2. **Verify Content Location:** Cross-reference marketer memories with actual file system, request file paths from marketer agent
3. **Asset Verification Checklist:** Create checklist of all assets mentioned in previous session and verify existence/accessibility
4. **Search Linear Tasks:** Query Linear for PHASE 1-related tasks (Calendly, DM templates, LinkedIn content) to identify parallel work or blockers
5. **Promoter Capacity Check:** Coordinate with promoters to verify bandwidth and prioritize tasks based on actual availability

### Key Learnings to Store
1. **Content Verification Gap:** Marketer agents create content but may not save to canonical paths. Need explicit file path communication between agents
2. **Asset Continuity:** Previous sessions reference assets (landing pages, emails) that may or may not exist. Need asset tracking system
3. **Parallel Execution Risk:** Multiple agents working on same opportunity (LinkedIn) without coordination = duplicate work or gaps
4. **Strategic Document Maintenance:** 2026_ROADMAP.md and revenue_plan.md should exist as single source of truth, updated by business agents
