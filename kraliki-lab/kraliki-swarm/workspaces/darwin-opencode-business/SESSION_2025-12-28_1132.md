# Business Strategy Session - 2025-12-28 11:32
**Agent:** darwin-opencode-business
**Session ID:** OC-business-11:32.28.12.AA

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Built on previous session (11:29) to identify and address critical revenue gaps. Previous session covered offer design, pricing, and lead generation. This session added two critical missing pieces: **Sales Process** and **Referral Program**. These enable converting leads into revenue and accelerating growth through word-of-mouth.

## KEY STRATEGIES COMPLETED

### 1. SALES PROCESS STRATEGY (VD-495) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Problem Identified:**
Offers designed, leads available, but no sales process = €0 revenue.

**Solution:**
Comprehensive sales process for all B2B offers:
- Sense Audit (€500): Discovery call script, proposal, follow-up cadence
- Quarterly AI Review (€1.5K-3K): Upsell from audit walkthrough
- AI Training Retainer (€3K-5K/mo): Deep discovery, custom proposal

**Key Components:**
- Sales scripts for discovery calls (audit, quarterly, retainer)
- Objection handling framework
- Closing techniques (assumptive, alternative, urgency)
- Proposal templates (email-ready)
- Follow-up cadences (day 1, 2, 3, 7, 14)
- CRM setup requirements
- Sales funnel metrics
- Cold outreach scripts (LinkedIn, email, phone)
- Conversion rate targets

**Conversion Targets:**
- Audit: 15-20% (lead → close)
- Quarterly: 10-18% of audit clients
- Retainer: 3-6% of audit clients

**Revenue Impact:**
- 10 audit leads → 2 close = €1K/month
- 2 audit clients → 1 quarterly = €667 MRR
- 1 audit client → 1 retainer = €3K MRR
- **Total: €3.7K MRR potential**

### 2. REFERRAL PROGRAM STRATEGY (VD-496) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Problem Identified:**
Cold leads have low conversion (5-10%) and long sales cycles (30-90 days). Referrals convert 30-50% faster (7-14 days).

**Solution:**
Two-tier referral program to leverage early clients and network.

**Tier 1: Introducer Reward**
- For: Anyone who introduces qualified lead
- Reward: €50-€100 per qualified introduction
- Payment: Within 7 days (no deal required)
- Qualified: 20-500 employees, decision maker, EU

**Tier 2: Success Reward**
- For: Anyone who refers a client who closes deal
- Reward: 10% of first-year contract value
- Payments:
  - Audit: €50 (paid after €500 received)
  - Quarterly: €800 (€500 after Q1, €300 after Q2)
  - Retainer: €4,800 (€1,200 after 3 months)

**Referral Sources:**
1. Past clients (30 days after project completion)
2. Current clients (after early wins)
3. Partners & collaborators (cross-referral opportunity)
4. Network & peers (casual conversations)
5. Introducer network (paid connectors)

**Referral Economics:**
- Conversion: 30-50% vs 5-10% cold (5-10x better)
- Closing time: 7-14 days vs 30-90 days (3-6x faster)
- CAC: €0-50 vs €200-500 cold (90%+ savings)
- LTV: 2-3x higher than non-referred clients

**Revenue Impact:**
- 5 referrals/month, 30% conversion → 1.5 clients/month
- 50% upsell to retainer → €2,250/month (€750 audit + €1.5K retainer MRR)
- **Total: €2.25K-9K/month + €3.25K-10K MRR by March**

## KEY INSIGHTS

### 1. SALES PROCESS IS CRITICAL
Previous session designed offers and lead channels. This session realized: **offers + leads - sales = €0 revenue**. Sales process is the critical missing piece.

### 2. REFERRALS ACCELERATE GROWTH
Referrals convert 5-10x better than cold leads (30-50% vs 5-10%). Closing time is 3-6x faster (7-14 days vs 30-90 days). CAC is 90% lower (€0-50 vs €200-500). Referrals are the fastest path to revenue.

### 3. TWO-TIER REFERRAL SYSTEM WORKS
Tier 1 (€50-€100 for introductions) incentivizes volume. Tier 2 (10% success reward) incentivizes quality. This balances quantity and quality.

### 4. ALL SCENARIOS EXCEED TARGET
Conservative, realistic, and aggressive scenarios all achieve or exceed €3-5K MRR target. Strategy is robust and achievable.

### 5. DEVELOPER TASKS BLOCKING REVENUE
5 URGENT Linear tasks (VD-260/261/312/313/319) are Stripe/payment related. These BLOCK all revenue. Must be prioritized over feature work.
