## SALES PROCESS

### Ideal Customer Profile

**Company Characteristics:**
- Size: 20-500 employees
- Currently using 1-10 AI tools
- Spending €500-5,000/month on AI tools
- Uncertain about ROI of AI investments
- Wanting to optimize AI spend
- Growing pains (tool bloat, low adoption)

**Buying Signals:**
- "We have so many AI tools, we're losing track"
- "Is AI actually saving us money?"
- "My team isn't using the tools we bought"
- "We need to prove AI ROI to leadership"
- Renewals coming up for AI tools

---

### Outreach Strategy

**Cold Outreach Email:**
```
Subject: Your AI tool ROI

Hi [Name],

I noticed your company is using several AI tools (great start!).

Most companies I work with are spending €2-10K/month on AI tools,
but only seeing 20% of potential ROI.

Common issues:
- Tools purchased but never activated (€500-2K/month wasted)
- Team doesn't know how to use features (30% adoption avg)
- No visibility into actual ROI

I offer a Quarterly AI Review Service that:
✅ Measures actual ROI of each tool
✅ Identifies waste (unused tools, redundant features)
✅ Recommends optimizations (consolidate, cancel, upgrade)
✅ Creates quarterly action plan

Cost: €1,500-3,000/quarter (pays for itself 2-3x via savings)

Want to see a sample report?

Best,
[Name]
```

**LinkedIn Post:**
```
We just reviewed a client's AI stack and found:
- 7 AI tools costing €3,200/month
- 3 tools completely unused (€1,200/month waste)
- 2 tools with overlapping features (can consolidate to 1)
- Team adoption at 35% (industry avg is 30%)

Result: They'll save €1,600/month (50% reduction!)
AND increase efficiency by activating unused features.

How much are you spending on AI tools monthly?
And do you know the ROI?

[Company Name] gets a quarterly review.
Should yours?
```

### Sales Script (Discovery Call)

**Introduction (5 min):**
"Hi [Name], thanks for taking the time. I help companies get maximum ROI from their AI investments through quarterly reviews.

Today I'd like to understand your current AI setup and see if this service would be valuable.

Shall we start with you telling me about which AI tools your team is currently using?"

---

**Discovery Questions (15 min):**
1. "Which AI tools are you using?" (List them)
2. "How many team members are actively using each tool?"
3. "Do you know the ROI of your AI investments?"
4. "What's your monthly/quarterly spend on AI tools?"
5. "What's your biggest challenge with AI tools right now?"
6. "Do you have visibility into who's using what?"
7. "How do you decide when to renew or cancel a tool?"

---

**Problem Agitation (5 min):**
Based on their answers, highlight:
- "So you're spending €X/month on AI tools, but only Y% of team is actively using them?"
- "You mentioned you're not sure about the ROI. That's common - 70% of companies don't track AI ROI."
- "You have 5 different tools doing similar things? You could probably consolidate to 2-3 and save money."

---

**Presentation (10 min):**
"Here's how Quarterly AI Review helps:

[Show sample report sections]

**What we analyze:**
- Tool utilization: Who's using what, how often
- ROI: Time saved vs cost per tool
- Adoption: Team proficiency and engagement
- Waste: Unused tools, redundant features
- Opportunities: New tools, workflows

**What you get:**
- Comprehensive quarterly report (15-25 pages)
- Review call to discuss findings
- Action plan with prioritized recommendations
- Implementation support (if Tier 2)

**Pricing:**
- Standard: €1,500/quarter (perfect for your size)
- Comprehensive: €3,000/quarter (if you want deeper analysis)

**ROI:**
Most clients see 2-3x return on this investment just from cost savings, not to mention efficiency gains.

For example, a client spending €3,000/month on tools:
- We identified €1,200/month in waste (40% savings!)
- They now spend €1,800/month and are more efficient
- ROI on our service: 400%+

---

**Objection Handling:**

**Objection: "€1,500/quarter seems expensive"**
Response: "I understand. Let me show you ROI:
- If you're spending €2,000/month on AI tools
- We identify 20% waste: €400/month savings
- Quarterly: €1,200 saved
- Our service: €1,500
- Year 1 ROI: 80% return

But that's just cost savings. The efficiency gains from using tools better easily double that.

Want me to run numbers based on your current spend?"

---

**Objection: "We don't have time for another meeting"**
Response: "Actually, it's pretty hands-off for you. We do 90% of the work:

- We pull data from your tool dashboards (5 min from you)
- We survey your team (10 min per person, anonymous)
- We compile everything into a report

You just review the report and hop on a 30-minute call to discuss findings.

Most clients tell me it saves them 10+ hours of trying to figure this out themselves."

---

**Objection: "We can do this internally"**
Response: "You absolutely can. Here's what you'd need:
- Someone dedicated to tracking metrics (10+ hours/quarter)
- Access to all tool dashboards
- Analysis skills (ROI calculation, trend analysis)
- Time to write a comprehensive report
- Objective perspective (hard to be objective about your own tools)

Plus, we bring benchmark data - you'll see how your AI usage compares to industry peers and competitors.

What's your plan for handling this quarterly review internally?"

---

**Closing (5 min):**
"Based on what you've shared, I think this would be valuable. You're spending €X/month on AI tools, and getting a quarterly review will likely save you 30-50% of that spend while also increasing efficiency.

Which tier feels right for you?
- Standard at €1,500/quarter
- Or Comprehensive at €3,000/quarter with more analysis

Once you decide, I can start the data collection process next week and have your first report ready in 2-3 weeks."
