### Objection Handling

**Objection 1: "We can't afford €3K/month"**
**Response:**
"I understand. Let me show you the ROI:
- Your team saves 50 hours/month × €30/hr = €1,500/month
- Tool consolidation saves €500/month
- You break even in 3 months
- After that, it's pure savings

Would you like me to run the numbers for your specific situation?"

---

**Objection 2: "We can just use ChatGPT and learn ourselves"**
**Response:**
"You're right, you can self-learn. But here's what we provide that self-study doesn't:
- Structured curriculum (not random learning)
- Industry-specific use cases
- Hands-on training with your actual workflows
- Ongoing support when you get stuck
- Team-wide adoption (not just self-starters)

Most companies that self-learn see 20% adoption. Our clients see 80%+.

Would you be interested in a 1-month pilot to see the difference?"

---

**Objection 3: "Our team is too busy for training"**
**Response:**
"That's exactly why you need this. Your team is busy because they're doing things manually that AI could automate.

In the first month, we focus on quick wins - tools that save 5+ hours/person/week.

So instead of taking time away from work, training gives them time back.

Want me to show you the 30-day quick-win plan?"

---

**Objection 4: "We're not ready yet - still exploring AI"**
**Response:**
"Perfect timing, actually. The best time to start training is before you commit to expensive tools.

We'll help you:
- Identify which tools are worth investing in
- Train your team to use them effectively
- Avoid the common mistakes companies make

Many clients wish they'd started training sooner - it would have saved them €20-50K in tool waste.

Ready for a discovery call to see where you are?"

---

**Objection 5: "12 months is too long"**
**Response:**
"I hear you. We do offer a 6-month minimum, but here's why 12 months makes sense:

Month 1-3: Foundation (basics)
Month 4-6: Optimization (apply to real work)
Month 7-12: Mastery (advanced, strategy)

You see real ROI in months 3-4. The remaining time is about scaling and maximizing value.

Most clients renew after 12 months because they see ongoing benefits.

Would a 6-month minimum work for you?"
