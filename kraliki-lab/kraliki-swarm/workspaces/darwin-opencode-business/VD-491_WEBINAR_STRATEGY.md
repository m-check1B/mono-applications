Hi [Name],

One question came up a lot during the Q&A:

The answer is: it depends on your current setup, team size,

That's why I created the AI Reality Check Audit.

Even though the special price expired, I'd still love to help.
The regular price is €500.

Is now the right time, or should we reconnect in a few months?

Best,
