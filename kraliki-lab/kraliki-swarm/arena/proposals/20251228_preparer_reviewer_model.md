# Pattern Proposal: Preparer-Reviewer Model (from Maximor)

## Source

- Company: Maximor (ex-Microsoft founders)
- Funding: $9M seed, Foundation Capital
- Last Updated: September 2025

## Pattern Description
The preparer-reviewer model mirrors traditional accounting teams:
- **Preparer agents** handle routine, high-volume tasks
- **Reviewer humans** (or senior agents) focus on oversight and validation
- **Audit trails** are generated by default, not as an afterthought

This creates a clear separation of concerns and built-in accountability.

## Evidence of Success
- Maximor raised $9M on this architecture
- Applied to enterprise finance (regulated domain)
- "Audit-Ready Agent" is their core differentiator
- Adopted by mid-market enterprises for compliance

## Proposed Integration

### 1. Formalize Role Separation in Genomes

**Preparer Genomes** (builders, patchers, coders):
```markdown
## ROLE: PREPARER

You are a preparer agent. Your work will be reviewed.

ALWAYS:
- Generate workpapers (detailed logs of what you did)
- Create reviewer notes (summary for human/senior agent)
- Maintain audit trail (every decision logged)
- Flag uncertainties for reviewer attention

Output format includes:
- WORK_LOG: Step-by-step actions taken
- REVIEWER_NOTE: "Key items for review: [list]"
- UNCERTAINTY_FLAGS: "Items needing human judgment: [list]"
```

**Reviewer Genomes** (QA, promoters, orchestrators):
```markdown
## ROLE: REVIEWER

You review work from preparer agents.

ALWAYS:
- Check WORK_LOG for completeness
- Validate REVIEWER_NOTEs
- Resolve UNCERTAINTY_FLAGS
- Approve or reject with rationale
```

### 2. Enhance Decision Trace System

```python
# In decision_trace.py, add new trace types:
PREPARER_TYPES = ["action", "workpaper", "uncertainty", "handoff"]
REVIEWER_TYPES = ["review", "approval", "rejection", "escalation"]
```

### 3. Audit Trail by Default

Every agent action should log to decision_trace.py:
```bash
python3 arena/decision_trace.py emit "[agent]" "action" "[what]" -r "[why]"
```

### 4. Reviewer Queue on Blackboard

```bash
# Preparer posts work for review
python3 arena/blackboard.py post "[agent]" "REVIEW_NEEDED: [task] - See workpaper at [path]" -t review

# Reviewer picks up
python3 arena/blackboard.py post "[reviewer]" "REVIEWED: [task] - APPROVED/REJECTED: [reason]" -t review
```

## Affected Files
- `genomes/*.md` - Add role designation (preparer/reviewer)
- `arena/decision_trace.py` - Add preparer/reviewer trace types
- `arena/blackboard.py` - Add #review channel tag

## Risk Assessment
- Risk Level: **Medium**
- Rollback plan: Remove role sections from genomes
- Requires minor updates to decision_trace.py

## Success Metrics
1. Clearer separation of autonomous vs supervised tasks
2. Audit trail coverage (% of actions with traces)
3. Reduction in errors reaching production (caught in review)
4. Human review time reduced (better workpapers)

## Implementation Effort
- Medium: Genome updates + decision_trace.py enhancement
- ~2-3 hours of work for full implementation

## Priority
**HIGH** - Aligns with enterprise requirements, improves reliability
