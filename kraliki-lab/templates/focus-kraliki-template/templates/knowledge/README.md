# Knowledge Capture Template

Purpose-built UI for capturing decision context, evidence, and ownership.
Runs inside Kraliki Swarm containers.

## Primary Flows

- Decision intake (problem, options, tradeoffs)
- Context linking (signals, docs, conversations)
- Knowledge base consolidation
- Decision audit timeline

## Notes

- No standalone backend
- Uses Swarm MCP endpoints only
