# Workflow Patterns

This directory contains prompt patterns for common Lab by Kraliki workflows.

## Available Patterns

| Pattern | Description | Use When... |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| **Build → Audit → Fix** | Build deliverable, audit quality, fix issues | Quality-critical work, production code |
| **Parallel Execution** | Multiple workstreams running simultaneously | Independent tasks, time-sensitive |
| **MVP → Iteration** | Build minimum version, iterate based on feedback | Unclear requirements, learning phase |
| **Research → Synthesis** | Gather information, combine into insights | Analysis, competitive intelligence |
| **Template Adaptation** | Use existing templates, customize for need | Common deliverables, repeatability |

## How to Use Patterns

Each pattern is a reusable workflow. When a task matches a pattern use case:

1. **Identify the pattern** from the table above
2. **Read the pattern file** for detailed instructions
3. **Adapt the pattern** to your specific task
4. **Execute following the pattern's steps**
5. **Store learnings** in mgrep for future reference

## Pattern Structure

Each pattern file contains:
- **Overview**: What the pattern does and when to use it
- **Step-by-Step Guide**: How to execute the pattern
- **Role Assignments**: Which worker handles each step
- **Success Criteria**: How to know if the pattern worked
- **Examples**: Real-world usage
- **Variations**: Adaptations for different contexts

## Creating New Patterns

If you discover a successful workflow:

1. **Document the steps** taken
2. **Identify the use case** when it's appropriate
3. **Note any variations** needed for different contexts
4. **Store as a new pattern** in this directory
5. **Index in mgrep** for future retrieval

## Pattern Metrics

Track pattern effectiveness:
- **Usage Count**: How often is it used?
- **Success Rate**: Does it consistently produce good results?
- **Time Savings**: How much faster vs alternative approaches?
- **User Satisfaction**: Do users like the outputs?

Use these metrics to:
- Promote effective patterns
- Retire ineffective ones
- Improve pattern documentation
- Train workers on best patterns
