# Demo Scenario: Content Audit

**Duration:** 10 minutes
**Pattern:** Multi-Model Analysis
**Target audience:** SEO agencies, content teams, marketing departments

---

## Pre-Demo Setup (30 sec)

```bash
# Have some sample content ready to audit
# Could use any blog post or marketing page
```

---

## Part 1: The Problem (1 min)

### What to Say:

> "Your client asks: 'Why isn't our content ranking?'
>
> You run it through an SEO tool - gets a score.
> You check with ChatGPT - gets some suggestions.
> You ask a copywriter - different feedback.
>
> Three opinions, no synthesis. And you're paying for all of them.
>
> Lab by Kraliki gives you coordinated analysis from multiple AI perspectives in one pass."

---

## Part 2: Execute Multi-Model Audit (6 min)

### Step 1: Input the Content

```bash
claude "I need a comprehensive audit of this content piece.

URL: [paste content or use sample]

Execute parallel analysis:
1. GEMINI: SEO audit (keywords, meta, structure, SERP potential)
2. CODEX: Technical audit (readability scores, accessibility, page speed implications)
3. OPUS: Strategic audit (value proposition clarity, conversion optimization, competitive positioning)

Synthesize all findings into a prioritized action list."
```

### What to Narrate:

- "Each model brings different expertise..."
- "Gemini focuses on search and discovery..."
- "Codex catches technical issues humans miss..."
- "Opus synthesizes the strategic picture..."

### Step 2: Review the Output

Show the consolidated report:
- SEO findings with specific fixes
- Technical issues ranked by impact
- Strategic recommendations
- Prioritized action list

## Part 3: The Value Proposition (2 min)

### What to Say:

> "What you just saw:
> - 3 specialized audits running concurrently
> - 1 synthesized, actionable report
> - Time: 3 minutes vs 3 hours of manual review
>
> For an agency, this means:
> - Faster turnaround on audits
> - More thorough analysis
> - Consistent quality across all clients
>
> Bill the same, spend 10% of the time."

### ROI Calculation (live):

> "If you bill $200/hour for content audits:
> - Old way: 3 hours = $600 revenue, 3 hours of work
> - Lab by Kraliki: 15 minutes = $600 revenue, 15 minutes of work
>
> Same revenue, freed-up capacity for more clients."

---

## Part 4: Expansion (30 sec)

### What to Say:

> "This is one content piece. Imagine running this across 50 blog posts, 20 landing pages, your entire content library.
>
> Find every SEO gap, every technical issue, every conversion opportunity - in an afternoon."

---

## Closing

> "Content audit is one use case. The same parallel analysis pattern works for:
> - Code review
> - Competitor analysis
> - Proposal evaluation
>
> What workflows could benefit from multi-perspective analysis in your organization?"
