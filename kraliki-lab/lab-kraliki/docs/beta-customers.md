## Tier 1: High-Value Beta Targets

### 1. Boutique Development Shops (5-15 people)
- **Profile:** Agency that builds custom software, always overcommitted
- **Pain:** Can't hire fast enough, quality varies, project timelines slip
- **Why Lab by Kraliki:** 1 senior dev + Lab by Kraliki = 3-dev output
- **Price sensitivity:** €499/mo is noise compared to €15K/mo in salaries
- **Where to find:** Clutch.co, local tech meetups, dev agency directories

### 2. SEO/Content Agencies
- **Profile:** Agencies producing high volumes of content
- **Pain:** Writer bottleneck, quality inconsistency, research time
- **Why Lab by Kraliki:** Research + draft + optimize in one workflow
- **Price sensitivity:** Already paying for multiple AI tools
- **Where to find:** SEO conferences, digital marketing communities

### 3. AI Automation Agencies (AAA Model)
- **Profile:** Agencies selling AI solutions but struggling to deliver
- **Pain:** Promise automation, spend weeks building it manually
- **Why Lab by Kraliki:** Actually deliver on AI promises with AI
- **Price sensitivity:** Low - they sell this exact value proposition
- **Where to find:** Liam Ottley communities, AI agency Discord servers

### 4. Lead Generation Consultancies
- **Profile:** B2B outreach specialists
- **Pain:** Research, personalization, follow-up at scale
- **Why Lab by Kraliki:** Deep prospect research + personalized outreach
- **Price sensitivity:** Medium - value based on deal sizes
- **Where to find:** LinkedIn, sales communities, Apollo.io power users

### 5. Senior Freelancer Collectives
- **Profile:** 2-4 senior freelancers working together loosely
- **Pain:** Want agency leverage without agency overhead
- **Why Lab by Kraliki:** Multiply output without hiring juniors
- **Price sensitivity:** Split cost, high perceived value
- **Where to find:** Toptal alumni, ex-FAANG freelancers

## Outreach Templates

### Email 1: Initial Contact (Value-First)

```
Subject: 16× output - thought you'd find this interesting

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] does [specific service]. I've been following your work on [recent project/post].

Quick context: We just documented a production run where one person delivered 4 complete marketing sites in 7 hours using multi-AI orchestration. Traditional dev time: 30+ hours with a team of 4.

The secret isn't better prompts—it's orchestration. Multiple AIs working as specialist roles (architect, coder, auditor) with persistent memory.

If you're curious how it works, I put together a 5-page deck with the exact methodology. Happy to send it over.

No pitch—just thought it might be useful for [Company]'s delivery capacity.

Best,
[Name]

### Email 2: Follow-up with Proof (Day 5)

```
Subject: Re: 16× output - the build log

Hi [Name],

Following up on my note from earlier this week.

Here's something concrete: our documented build log showing the 4-site benchmark.

Key metrics:
• 4 complete sites (i18n, dark mode, responsive)
• 7 hours total
• 1 person steering, 3 AI agents executing

We're packaging this as Lab by Kraliki—a pre-configured environment + the methodology.

Currently looking for 5 agencies to beta test it (free/discounted setup).

Would [Company] be interested in a 15-min demo?

Best,
[Name]
```

### Email 3: Direct Demo Offer (Day 10)

```
Subject: Last note - Lab by Kraliki demo

Hi [Name],

Final follow-up on Lab by Kraliki.

Quick value prop: If your devs spend 20% of their time on context-switching and rework, Lab by Kraliki pays for itself in week 1.

€499/mo vs €3,000/mo for a junior dev.
If it delivers 10% of a junior's output, you're ahead.

I have 3 demo slots this week. Reply "demo" and I'll send a calendar link.

Best,
[Name]
```

### LinkedIn Connect Request

```
