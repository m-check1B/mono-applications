# Lab by Kraliki - Competitive Analysis

**Source:** Gemini consultation (Dec 2, 2025)

---

## Positioning: "Capped-Risk R&D Lab"

### The Reframe

**Don't compare to:**
- €20/mo Copilot subscription
- €10/mo ChatGPT Plus

**Compare to:**
- €3,000/mo junior developer salary
- €5,000/mo agency retainer
- €15,000/mo team expansion

### The Pitch

```
"For €499/month, you get a capped-risk R&D lab.

If it doesn't work → you lost €499
If it works → you gained a team"
```

## Direct Competitors

### 1. Single AI Tools

| Tool | Price | What They Sell | Our Advantage |
|------|-------|----------------|---------------|
| ChatGPT Plus | €20/mo | One chat interface | Multi-agent orchestration |
| Claude Pro | €20/mo | One chat interface | Persistent memory, workflows |
| Gemini Advanced | €20/mo | One chat interface | Combined with other models |
| GitHub Copilot | €20/mo | Code autocomplete | Full development workflows |

**Their Gap:** Single tool, single use case, no orchestration

### 2. AI Development Platforms

| Platform | Price | What They Sell | Our Advantage |
|----------|-------|----------------|---------------|
| Replit AI | $20/mo | AI-assisted coding | Full stack orchestration |
| Cursor | $20/mo | AI code editor | Beyond just code |

### 3. AI Automation Tools

| Tool | Price | What They Sell | Our Advantage |

| Make.com | $50+/mo | Visual automation | Complex multi-step AI tasks |

### 4. AI Agencies / Consulting

| AI consultants | €200+/hr | Advice, implementation | Product not service |
| Dev agencies | €150+/hr | Custom development | Self-service, instant |

## Why We Win

### 1. No Direct Competition

Nobody else sells "multi-AI orchestration as a service."

They sell:
- AI tools (use it yourself)
- AI training (learn to use it)
- AI consulting (we'll do it for you)

We sell:
- The capability itself, ready to deploy

### 2. Proven Results

Day 1 production evidence:
- 16× productivity documented
- 4 sites in 7 hours
- Reproducible methodology

Competitors sell promises. We sell proof.

### 3. Multiple Moats

| Moat | Why It's Defensible |
|------|---------------------|
| Pattern Library | 500+ tested patterns take years to build |
| Memory (mgrep) | The more they use it, harder to leave |
| Community | User contributions multiply value |
| Experience | Months of real-world orchestration learning |

### 4. Better Unit Economics

| Factor | Us | Competitors |
|--------|-----|-------------|
| Delivery cost | €50-100/mo | €150+/hr |
| Scale | Infinite | Time-bound |
| Margin | 80%+ | 30-50% |
| Recurring | Yes | Project-based |

## Objection Handling

### "I can just use ChatGPT"

```
"You can buy chicken at the market.
That doesn't make you a Michelin chef.

ChatGPT is an ingredient.
Lab by Kraliki is the professional kitchen."
```

### "Too expensive"

```
"€499/month vs €3,000/month for a junior dev.

If Lab by Kraliki replaces 10% of a junior's work,
you're already ahead."
```

### "What if it doesn't work for me?"

```
"That's why we do a 15-minute demo first.
If your use case doesn't fit, we'll tell you.

No hard feelings, no wasted money."
```

### "Can't I build this myself?"

```
"Absolutely. We did - took us 6 months of trial and error.

You can invest that time, or you can
start producing in week 1.

Your call."
```
