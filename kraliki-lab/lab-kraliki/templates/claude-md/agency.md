## Client Work Workflow

When working on client projects:

1. **Always ask for context first**
   - Which client is this for?
   - Is there an existing brand guide?
   - What's the deadline?
   - Who approves?

2. **Use client folder structure**
   ```
   /clients/[client-name]/
   ├── assets/        # Brand assets, logos, images
   ├── content/       # Copy, content calendar
   ├── designs/       # Figma exports, mockups
   ├── code/          # Development files
   └── docs/          # Briefs, contracts, notes
   ```

3. **Never mix client assets**
   - Each client's work stays isolated
   - No cross-pollination of brand elements

---

## Forbidden Actions

- Never share one client's work with another client
- Never use copyrighted images without license verification
- Never deploy to production without explicit approval
- Never commit API keys or credentials to repositories
- Never promise delivery dates without checking capacity
- Never use competitor brand elements as references in deliverables

---

## Billable vs Non-Billable

**Billable (log time):**
- Design work
- Development
- Client meetings
- Content creation
- Revisions within scope

**Non-billable (don't log):**
- Internal tooling
- Learning/research (unless client-specific)
- Admin tasks
- Fixing our own mistakes
