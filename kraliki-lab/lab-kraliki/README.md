# Lab by Kraliki — Multi-AI Orchestration Stack

**The 16× productivity multiplier, packaged.**

---

========================================
ONE PRODUCT / ONE ENGINE / MANY TEMPLATES
Swarm + Voice is the core engine. Templates are the product surface.
========================================

## What Is This?

Lab by Kraliki is the productized version of the multi-AI orchestration workflow that delivered 16× productivity gains (4 roles × 4× speed).

**The insight:** The methodology for orchestrating multiple AI agents is more valuable than what they build.

### Why This Is Genius

| Advantage | Explanation |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Almost NO CODE** | Product = prompts + config + methodology |
| **Cheap infrastructure** | Hetzner EU+US is fucking cheap |
| **Expensive AI made cheap** | CLIProxyAPI unifies all subscriptions |
| **Easy to evolve** | New patterns = product improvements |
| **Built-in upsell** | Modules/templates can be added to any box |
| **Community flywheel** | More users = more templates = more value |

### The Flywheel

```
More customers → More use cases → Better patterns → Higher value → More customers
         ↓
    Community forms → Templates shared → Marketplace revenue
```

## The Problem

Everyone is learning "prompt engineering" — how to talk to one AI.

Nobody is learning **AI orchestration** — how to run multiple specialized AIs as a team.

Result: They get 2× productivity. We get 16×.

## The Solution

A pre-configured environment where:

### The Beautiful Part

**This is almost a NO CODE product.**

| What we sell | What it actually is |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Software | Configuration |
| Platform | Hetzner VM |
| AI capabilities | API subscriptions |
| Knowledge | Prompts + patterns |
| Support | Documentation |

**Zero proprietary code needed.** The value is in:
1. Knowing these tools exist
2. Knowing how to combine them
3. Having polished prompts
4. Having proven patterns
5. Packaging it so normies can use it

## Risk Analysis (Agent Validated)

### Strategic Risks (Gemini)

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Day 2 Ops** | Fleet management needed - updates across 1000 VMs | Immutable infra, versioned images |
| **API/Model Changes** | OpenAI/Anthropic changes break patterns | Abstract patterns, test matrix |
| **Support Eats Margin** | 3 tickets = no profit on €299 customer | Lock down env, ruthless automation |
| **Gym Membership Churn** | Unused box = canceled subscription | Passive value (daily digests) |

### Technical Risks (Codex)

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| **Resource Limits** | CPX31 handles 1-3 users max | Scale to CPX41, monitor usage |
| **CLIProxyAPI Raw** | No auth, no rate limits, no sandbox | Add layers: JWT, Traefik middleware |
| **Multi-tenant Security** | Command injection risk | nsjail/bubblewrap per tenant |
| **No Observability** | Can't debug customer issues | Prometheus + Loki from day 1 |

### Competitive Moat

| Moat | Why It Works |
|------|--------------|
| **Memory (mgrep)** | The more they use it, harder to leave |
| **Pattern Library** | 500+ tested patterns can't be copied overnight |
| **Smart Proxy** | Auto-optimize prompts, select cheapest model |
| **Community** | Contributors create value we don't |

---

## Target Customers

### Primary: Agencies & Consultancies

- Digital agencies tired of hiring
- Consulting firms wanting leverage
- Freelancers wanting to scale
- Dev shops with more work than people

**Pain:** Can't hire fast enough, quality varies, coordination overhead

**Solution:** One person + Lab by Kraliki = 4-person team output

### Secondary: Tech-Forward Companies

- Startups wanting speed advantage
- Product teams with bottlenecks
- Innovation labs

**Pain:** Slow iteration, dependencies on specialists

**Solution:** Any competent person becomes a multi-disciplinary team

---

## Competitive Advantages

### 1. First Mover

Nobody else is selling multi-AI orchestration as a product. Everyone sells:
- Single AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude)
- AI training ("prompt engineering")
- AI consulting (expensive, doesn't scale)

We sell **the capability itself**, ready to use.

### 2. Proven Results

Not theory. We have documented 16× productivity from Day 1.

### 3. Global Scale

Unlike local consulting:
- No geography limits
- Same product everywhere
- Hetzner has data centers globally
- English-first market

### 4. Recurring Revenue

VM rental = monthly recurring revenue
- Predictable
- Scalable
- High margin

## Why This Before Education?

| Factor | Education | Lab by Kraliki |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Market | Local (CZ first) | Global |
| Scale | Time-bound | Infinite |
| Revenue | €149-2,500/sale | €299-499/month recurring |
| Delivery | Manual | Automated |
| Competition | Everyone | Nobody |
| Proof | Theory | Working system |

**Lab by Kraliki is the higher-leverage play.**

Education becomes a marketing channel for Lab by Kraliki — "See what's possible, then buy the tool."
