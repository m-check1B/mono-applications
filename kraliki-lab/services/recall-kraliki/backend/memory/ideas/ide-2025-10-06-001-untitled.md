# Idea: AI Adoption Readiness Testing Suites

## The Opportunity

Rapidly develop testing suites for people and companies to assess their AI adoption readiness.

## Why This is a Gold Mine

**Lead Generation**:
- Every test = qualified lead
- Companies want to know: "Are we ready for AI?"
- People want to know: "Am I AI-ready for my job?"
- Assessment creates urgency and awareness

**Market Timing**:
- AI adoption accelerating in 2025-2026
- Companies unsure where to start
- Fear of being left behind
- No standardized readiness assessment exists

## Two Product Lines

### 1. Company AI Readiness Assessment

**What We Test**:
- Technical infrastructure readiness
- Team skills and AI literacy
- Process automation opportunities
- Data quality and availability
- Security and compliance readiness
- Cultural readiness for AI adoption

**Deliverable**:
- Readiness score (0-100)
- Gap analysis report
- Prioritized roadmap
- ROI projections

**Pricing**: $5K-$50K per assessment (based on company size)

### 2. Individual AI Skills Assessment

**What We Test**:
- AI tool proficiency (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
- Prompt engineering skills
- Critical thinking with AI outputs
- Automation mindset
- AI ethics awareness

**Deliverable**:
- Skills scorecard
- Learning path recommendations
- Certification ("AI-Ready Professional")

**Pricing**: $99-$499 per person (B2C) or volume pricing for companies

## Lead Generation Strategy

**Free Tier**:
- Quick 10-question assessment
- Basic readiness score
- "Unlock full report for $X"

**Lead Capture**:
- Email required for results
- Company info for B2B leads
- Permission to follow up

**Nurture Sequence**:
1. Send assessment results
2. Case study: "How Company X improved from 40 to 85 readiness"
3. Offer: Deep-dive consultation
4. Pitch: Full AI adoption roadmap service

## Revenue Model

**Year 1 Conservative**:
- 100 free assessments/month
- 10% conversion to paid ($5K avg) = $60K/month
- Individual assessments: 50/month × $299 = $15K/month
- **Total: $75K/month = $900K/year**

**Year 2 Scale**:
- 500 free assessments/month
- Enterprise clients ($50K+)
- Certification program ($2K/person)
- **Target: $3M/year**
