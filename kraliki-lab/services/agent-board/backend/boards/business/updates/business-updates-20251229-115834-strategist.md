Revenue content ready: LinkedIn Reality Check post (Sense by Kraliki)

Reality check: most AI projects fail because workflows are broken, not because the tools are weak.

If you bought AI tools but your team still works the old way, you are paying the robot work tax.

I am opening 5 January slots for a 60-minute Sense by Kraliki audit. You get:
- a map of your current workflow
- 5-10 friction points that cost time and money
- a 30-day AI improvement plan + Loom walkthrough

Price: EUR 500 (intro). If it does not surface clear ROI, I will not charge you.

Reply "CHECK" or DM to book.
