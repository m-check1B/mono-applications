# Academy L1-L4 Curriculum Research Report (VD-245)

## 1. Level 1: Student (The Confidence Builder)
**Goal**: Bridge the AI confidence gap for non-tech professionals.
- **Foundations**: LLM mechanics (tokens, context windows) to remove the "magic" mystery.
- **Safety First**: Data privacy protocols and misinformation spotting.
- **Reasoning Partner**: Frameworks for delegating cognitive tasks, not just generating text.
- **Workflow Mapping**: Identifying "Low-Hanging Fruit" for automation in daily routines.

## 2. Level 2: Pro (Advanced Tool Workflows)
**Goal**: High-leverage execution for professionals.
- **Cursor Masterclass**: Parallel agents with Git Worktrees, .cursorrules governance, and YOLO Mode builds.
- **Midjourney v7 Consistency**: Systematic use of --sref (style) and --oref (character) for production-grade business assets.
- **Perplexity BI**: Deep Research multi-pass queries, Space-based team intelligence, and Pages for shareable insights.

## 3. Level 4: Business Guru (The Ocelot Model)
**Goal**: Replicate the Verduona "1-Person Empire" model.
- **Vertical Integration**: Strategy for moving customers from Academy -> Advisory -> Labs -> Platform.
- **Sovereign Infrastructure**: "Own the Factory" philosophy using Hetzner + Darwin2 Swarm.
- **Swarm Operations**: Architecting and managing multi-agent teams for 16x productivity.
- **High-Ticket Packaging**: Positioning self-hosted "Private AI Factories" vs SaaS rentals.

## 4. Competitive Benchmarking
- **Edge identified**: Most courses teach tools (Cursor/Midjourney). We teach **Systems** (The Ocelot Model). Level 4 is a blue ocean for "Founder Mentorship" in AI implementation.
