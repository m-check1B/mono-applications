# Research Report: AI Academy Competitors & Secret Management

## 1. AI Automation Academy: Competitive Landscape

### Level 1 & 2 (Literacy & Professional Tools)
* **Competitors:** Coursera (DeepLearning.AI), Udemy (Mammoth Interactive), Google AI Essentials.
* **Pricing Analysis:** Our €49-299 range is competitive with premium bootcamps. Most competitors offer fragmented tool-based learning.
* **Our USP:** The **Unified Roadmap**. We don't just teach tools; we teach the **Darwin2 Swarm Orchestration** and **16x Productivity** framework.

### Level 3 & 4 (Guru/Founder Masterminds)
* **High-End Rivals:** Sidecar AI ($10k), Outskill AI ($895 workshop).
* **Our Position:** Level 4 (€3k-5k) is strategically priced as a mid-to-high tier offering. Focus on "Replicating the Ocelot Model" is a unique value proposition that rivals haven't productized yet.

## 2. CC-Lite: Contact Center Simulation
* **Direct Competitors:** Virti, Call Simulator, SymTrain.
* **Observation:** The market is moving toward "Immersive AI Role-play". CC-Lite's Scenario Builder is the key differentiator for custom enterprise needs.

## 3. Secret Management: Doppler vs Infisical
* **Verdict: Infisical.**
* **Why:** Aligns with Magic Box "Self-hosted" ethos. Doppler is SaaS-only. Infisical provides PKI, secret scanning, and rotation while being fully deployable on our Hetzner infrastructure via Docker Compose.
* **Implementation:** Standard Docker Compose deployment on Ubuntu 24.04 (Hetzner) is well-documented and feasible for Q1.

## 4. Strategic Recommendations
* **Academy:** Lean into the "System vs Tools" narrative in marketing.
* **Infisical:** Start the "1 day spike" for Infisical deployment immediately to secure dev/staging secrets.
* **CC-Lite:** Market it as an "Enterprise Dojo" for rapid scenario deployment.
