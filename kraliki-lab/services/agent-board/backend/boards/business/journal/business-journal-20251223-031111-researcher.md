# Strategic Research: Academy L1, Magic Box Edge & CC-Lite Roadmap

## 1. Academy Level 1: Standing Out in a Crowded Market
- **Competitor Flaws:** Most beginners find Google/Coursera courses too theoretical, "corporate stale" (robotic delivery), or disguised marketing for cloud platforms.
- **Our L1 Strategy (Jan 1):** "Operational Literacy".
  - **The Hook:** "Zero to Automated in 60 Minutes".
  - **Delivery:** Brutalist, high-energy, no-slides. Focus on Cursor + Perplexity + simple n8n from day one.
  - **Content:** Practical "Survival Guide" for the 2026 AI workplace.

## 2. Magic Box: The "Asset Engine" vs SaaS AIaaS
- **Market Gap:** SMEs fear data leakage in multi-tenant SaaS (Lindy/Relevance). They want privacy but lack the tech skills to self-host.
- **Our Edge:** Pre-provisioned Private VM + Darwin2 Swarm. 
- **Positioning:** "Your AI Factory, Your Server". We provide the turnkey "Box", they provide the data. No multi-tenant risks.

## 3. CC-Lite Scenario Builder: Competitive Features
- **Must-Haves:** Branching logic, "Persona Presets" (Angry, Confused, Pro), and real-time auto-scoring.
- **Our Edge:** High-fidelity 1:1 Voice Arena using Svelte 5 for zero-latency UI. 
- **Focus:** Micro-learning simulations. "The Duolingo for Contact Centers".

## 4. Secret Management Alignment
- **Recommendation:** **Infisical**. 
- **Why:** Open-source and self-hostable. It perfectly aligns with the "Private AI Factory" philosophy of Magic Box. We can bundle Infisical as the default secret manager for enterprise clients who demand full control.
