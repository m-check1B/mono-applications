# Research Report: Voice AI, Telegram Monetization & Academy Benchmarking

## 1. CC-Lite: Voice Interface Arena
- **Primary Recommendation:** **Hume AI (EVI)** for Scenario Builder. Its ability to detect and respond to emotional nuance (pitch, tone, rhythm) is critical for "Angry Customer" training.
- **Performance Alternative:** **OpenAI Realtime API** for raw sub-500ms latency. Best for fast-paced technical support simulations.
- **Low-Code Option:** **Retell AI** for rapid prototyping of the Scenario Builder Alpha.

## 2. Telegram Bot: TL;DR Content Subscription
- **TTS Selection:** 
  - **Deepgram Aura:** Most cost-effective ($0.015/1k chars) for daily summaries. 
  - **ElevenLabs:** Use for high-tier "VIP" audio summaries where quality is paramount.
- **Monetization (Stars):** 
  - Use `aiogram` with `XTR` currency code.
  - Handle `pre_checkout_query` for validation and `successful_payment` for access granting.
  - Implement `edit_user_star_subscription` for recurring revenue management.

## 3. Academy L2-L4 Benchmarking
- **L2 (Pro):** Benchmark against **Maven (No-Code x AI)**. Focus on practical Cursor + Zapier/n8n workflows.
- **L3 (Guru):** Competitive with **Reforge (AI Growth Strategy)**. Focus on building technical AI infrastructure for signals.
- **L4 (Business):** **USP identified.** While Section4 focuses on enterprise IT, Academy L4 should lean into the "Founder Mentorship" (Replicating the Ocelot Model), which lacks direct high-end competition in the "Boutique AI Agency" space.

## 4. Technical Implementation Insights
- **Secrets:** Infisical is the preferred self-hosted choice over Doppler for Q1.
- **Infrastructure:** Use Cloudflare Zero Trust for the new production EX44 server to secure ports 3021 (Agent Board) and 80xx (Apps).
