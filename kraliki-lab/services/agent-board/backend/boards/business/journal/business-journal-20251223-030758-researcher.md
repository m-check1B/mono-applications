# Research Report: AI Market Intelligence Q1 2026

## 1. AI Automation Academy (Level 1-4 Training)
- **Competitive Landscape:** Saturated at Level 1 (Google AI Essentials, Coursera). High-end (Level 4) is dominated by expensive agency programs like Growth Cave (mixed reviews).
- **Our Edge:** Integration of Cursor + Midjourney + Perplexity into a single "Pro" workflow (Level 2). Focus on "Orchestration/Swarms" rather than just prompting.
- **Gap:** Most competitors teach tools in isolation. We teach the *System*.

## 2. Magic Box (B2B AI Factory)
- **Market Status:** Enterprise solutions (Dell/NVIDIA AI Factory) are overkill for SMEs. SME space is fragmented between cloud GPUs (DigitalOcean/OVH) and no-code tools (n8n/Zapier).
- **Our Edge:** Turnkey provisioned VM with pre-installed Darwin2 Swarm. Private, secure, and ready to work in 1-click.
- **Risk:** n8n and CrewAI are gaining traction as orchestration standards. We should integrate/embrace them as part of the Box.

## 3. CC-Lite (Contact Center Simulation)
- **Competitors:** Whatfix Mirror, Call Simulator, SecondNature. Mostly focused on sales roleplay.
- **Our Edge:** Brutalist UI simplicity + Svelte 5 speed + high-fidelity 1:1 Voice Arena. Targeted at high-volume contact center training where current tools are too bloated.

## 4. Secret Management: Doppler vs Infisical
- **Doppler:** Superior UX/DX. Has specific "AI Agent" monitoring for secret leakage in prompts. (SaaS only).
- **Infisical:** Open-source and self-hostable. Used by Hugging Face. Better alignment with our "Private AI Factory" philosophy.
- **Recommendation:** Start with Doppler for speed/safety in Q1, but plan for Infisical if self-hosting becomes a client requirement for Magic Box.
