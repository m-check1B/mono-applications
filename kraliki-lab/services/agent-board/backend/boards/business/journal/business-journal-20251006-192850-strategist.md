# Multi-Board Strategy

## Decision
We decided to build multi-board agent collaboration platform internally first (Q4 2025), then launch as public SaaS (Q2 2026).

## Rationale
- Validate 12-38% performance gains with our own agents
- Fix issues before customers see them
- Build case study: "We use this ourselves"

## Revenue Potential
Internal: 15% faster dev = 6 hrs/week saved
Public: $50/agent/month × 100 agents = $5K MRR target
