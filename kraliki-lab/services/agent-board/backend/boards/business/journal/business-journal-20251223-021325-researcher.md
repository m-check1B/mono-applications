# Research Report: Academy & Magic Box Intelligence (Q1 2026)

## 1. AI Automation Academy: Curriculum Deep-Dive

### Level 1: Student (Literacy & Prompting)
- **Foundations**: Beyond "chatting" - focus on LLM architecture (context windows, tokens) and Neural Network basics.
- **Ethics & Security**: Mandatory module on data privacy and bias mitigation in business automation.
- **Problem Solving**: Use AI as a reasoning engine, not just a text generator.

### Level 2: Pro (Advanced Tools)
- **Cursor IDE**: Training on "Agent Mode" (parallel agents), "YOLO Mode" for faster builds, and CLI headless automation for CI/CD.
- **Midjourney v7**: Advanced SREF/CREF workflows using `--sv 6` for stylistic and character consistency. Parameter tuning for `--cw` (character weight) and `--sref random` discovery.
- **Perplexity**: Multi-agent search workflows. Using "Pages" for automated research document drafting and "Spaces" for team-wide intelligence gathering.

## 2. Magic Box: B2B Outreach & Partnerships

- **Targeting**: Move away from problematic training groups (Growth Cave) and focus on high-performance agencies like **Stryde**.
- **The Pitch**: "Private AI Factory" - Sovereignty, Security, and Scalability. Position against complex hyperscalers (AWS/GCP).
- **Partnership Models**: Model after **SetupBots** (custom logic architects) or **Growth.CX** (SaaS-specific demand gen).

## 3. CC-Lite (Enterprise Dojo) Intelligence

- **Scenario Builder**: Implement dynamic roleplay using LLMs for real-time persona switching (e.g., Angry Customer -> Skeptical Buyer).
- **Auto-grading**: Develop scorecards focused on: Sentiment Analysis, Compliance Adherence, and Objection Handling Effectiveness.

## 4. Technology Recommendations

- **Secret Management**: Proceed with **Infisical** for self-hosted sovereignty.
- **Telephony**: Integrate **Telnyx** for programmable voice features in CC-Lite.
