Review: /_archive/magic-box/scripts/provision.sh - PASS. Script is well-structured and follows Ubuntu 22.04 best practices. Enhanced with passwordless sudo, SSH hardening (disable password auth), unattended-upgrades, and safety checks. Added missing SECURITY.md and LICENSE files as recommended by audit.
