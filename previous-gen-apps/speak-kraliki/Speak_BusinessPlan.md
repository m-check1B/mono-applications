- Czech language native
- SME-friendly flat-fee pricing
- Anonymized insights with action tracking

**Target:** €200-500K ARR within 24 months, 50-100 customers

## 1. Problem Statement

### Why CEOs Don't Know What's Really Happening

1. **Middle management filters information** — Job security incentives mean problems get hidden
2. **Text surveys produce fake answers** — People write "safe" responses
3. **Exit interviews come too late** — Employee is already leaving
4. **1:1 meetings are biased** — Direct manager present = censorship
5. **HR is perceived as "management side"** — Not trusted

### Consequences

- Problems escalate to crisis before visible
- Talent leaves "suddenly" (signals were there)
- Toxic cultures persist for years
- Employee ideas never reach leadership
- CEO lives in information bubble

---

## 2. Solution

### Monthly AI Voice Conversations

Every employee receives a link each month. They click, speak for 5-7 minutes with an AI interviewer. The AI asks follow-up questions based on responses. Results are anonymized and aggregated for leadership dashboard.

### Why Voice Beats Text

| Text Surveys | Voice Conversations |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Formal, safe answers | Natural, honest responses |
| No follow-up possible | AI probes deeper on interesting points |
| Feels like a form | Feels like being heard |
| Misses emotion/tone | Captures hesitation, frustration |
| 30% participation | Target: 70%+ participation |

---

## 3. Competitive Landscape

### Existing Players (All Text-Based)

| Competitor | Approach | Pricing | Gap |
|------------|----------|---------|-----|
| Culture Amp | Text surveys | $5-8/employee/mo | US-centric, expensive |
| 15Five | Weekly check-ins | $4-14/employee/mo | Manager sees = bias |
| Lattice | Performance + engagement | $6-11/employee/mo | Complex, enterprise |
| Peakon | Text surveys | $$$ | Enterprise only |
| Officevibe | Pulse surveys | $3.50/employee/mo | Generic, no depth |

### Our Position

**NO ONE does voice-first AI employee intelligence in CEE.**

We're not competing with Culture Amp — we're creating a new category.

## 5. Go-to-Market Strategy

### Ideal Customer Profile

- **Size:** 20-300 employees (sweet spot: 50-150)
- **Industry:** Tech, manufacturing, services, retail chains
- **Geography:** CZ first, then SK, PL, HU
- **Buyer:** CEO, COO, HR Director (NOT middle management)
- **Trigger:** Recent turnover, growth pains, bad survey results
- **Budget:** Has HR budget, values retention

### Sales Motion

**Phase 1 — Founder-Led Sales (0-20 customers)**
- Personal network outreach
- LinkedIn targeting CEOs/HR Directors
- Speaking at HR events, podcasts
- Content: "Proč písemné ankety lžou"
- Free pilot (1 month) for case study

**Phase 2 — Repeatable Sales (20-50 customers)**
- Hire 1 sales person
- Defined pitch, demo, objection handling
- Referral program
- Partner with HR consultants

**Phase 3 — Scale (50+ customers)**
- Inbound marketing (SEO, content)
- Partnerships (HR software, payroll)
- Expand to Poland, Slovakia

### Sales Hook (30 seconds)

> "Víte, co si opravdu myslí vaši zaměstnanci? Ne co říkají HR, ne co píšou do anket — ale co by řekli, kdyby se jich někdo zeptal v soukromém rozhovoru? My jsme postavili AI, která přesně tohle dělá."

### Objection Handling

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "Máme vlastní ankety" | Ankety měří co lidi NAPÍŠOU. My měříme co CÍTÍ. Voice prozradí víc. |
| "Lidi nebudou mluvit upřímně" | Právě proto voice, ne text. A 100% anonymní. Po rozhovoru si můžou přečíst a upravit přepis. |
| "Je to drahé" | Kolik stojí jeden odchod? Jeden toxic manager? Jeden rok špatné kultury? |
| "Co GDPR?" | Plně compliant. Data v EU. Anonymizace. DPA připravená. |
| "Naši lidi neumí s technologií" | Stačí kliknout link a mluvit. Žádná appka, žádná registrace. Můžou i psát. |

## 7. Competitive Moat

1. **First mover in CEE voice intelligence** — Brand recognition
2. **Data moat** — More companies = better benchmarks
3. **Czech language tuning** — Competitors are English-first
4. **Integration into platform** — Synergy with Task/Call products
5. **Customer relationships** — Switching costs high (historical data)

---

## 8. Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Low employee participation | HIGH | Trust Layer, short sessions, visible Action Loop |
| Gemini Czech quality | LOW | Fallback: Whisper + GPT-4 |
| Companies don't buy | MEDIUM | Free pilots, strong ROI story |
| Middle managers block | MEDIUM | Position as "culture radar", not surveillance |
| GDPR/legal concerns | MEDIUM | DPA ready, text-only option for strict orgs |
| Competition copies | LOW | First mover, data moat, speed |

---

## 9. Roadmap

| Phase | Timeline | Goal |
|-------|----------|------|
| **Phase 0** | Now (waiting for Gemini) | Build skeleton, legal, pre-sell pilots |
| **Phase 1** | Gemini GA + 4 weeks | Working MVP |
| **Phase 2** | MVP + 4 weeks | 3-5 pilot companies |
| **Phase 3** | Alpha + 4 weeks | 10 paying customers |
| **V2** | +3 months | Trends, predictions, 35 customers |
| **Poland** | +3 months | Polish language, local sales |

---

## 10. Why Now

1. **AI timing perfect** — Gemini 2.5 Flash makes Czech voice affordable
2. **Post-COVID awareness** — Companies care more about culture
3. **Talent war** — Retention is top priority for CEOs
4. **Survey fatigue** — Everyone knows text surveys don't work
5. **First mover window** — 12-18 months before copycats catch up

---

## 11. Team & Resources

**Current:**
- Founder: 30 years business consulting, HR network, technical capability
- Infinite runway: 50K CZK/month burn, sustainable indefinitely

**Needed:**
- Month 6: 1 sales person
- Month 12: 1 customer success person

**Synergies:**
- Shared tech with Call Centrum + Plánovač
- Same customer base = cross-sell potential

---

## 12. Exit Considerations

**Potential acquirers:**
- HR software companies (Personio, HiBob, Deel)
- Payroll providers expanding to engagement
- Enterprise players entering CEE (Workday, SAP)

**Timeline:** Build to €500K+ ARR, then either continue growing or entertain acquisition offers.

**Valuation multiple:** HR SaaS typically 5-10x ARR = €2.5-5M potential exit at €500K ARR.
