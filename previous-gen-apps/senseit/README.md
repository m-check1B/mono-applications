Sense by Kraliki (formerly SenseIt) is a B2B workflow audit service. It is not
an OCR or document analysis product, and it is not the HSP Telegram bot.

- Deliverables: friction heatmap, savings estimate, 90-day roadmap, Loom walkthrough.
- Focused on business workflows (sales ops, client delivery, finance ops, reporting).

## Offer

- **Reality Check Audit:** EUR 500 one-time.
- **Guarantee:** Refund if we cannot identify at least EUR 5,000 in annual savings.
- **Payment:** Stripe link pending; manual bank transfer available via sales@verduona.com.

## Delivery Flow

1. Intake questionnaire.
2. 60-minute audit call (screen share walkthrough).
3. Report and Loom delivered within 48 hours.
4. Optional implementation retainer (Lab by Kraliki).
