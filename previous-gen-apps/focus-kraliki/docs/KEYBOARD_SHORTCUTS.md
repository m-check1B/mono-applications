## Fast Path Commands

Fast path commands allow you to quickly create items without using the AI:

+  Buy groceries        → Creates task: "Buy groceries"
/task Review PR 123    → Creates task: "Review PR 123"
# Meeting notes         → Creates note: "Meeting notes"
/note Project ideas    → Creates note: "Project ideas"
/idea New feature      → Creates idea: "New feature"
/bug Login broken      → Creates bug: "[BUG] Login broken"
```

## Tips

1. **Use Fast Path for Speed**: When you know exactly what you want to create, fast path commands are faster than AI processing.

2. **AI for Complex Requests**: For complex, multi-step tasks or when you need suggestions, use natural language with the AI assistant.

3. **Keyboard Navigation**: All panels and forms are fully keyboard navigable for accessibility.

4. **Gestures on Mobile**: On mobile devices, use swipe gestures for quick task management.
