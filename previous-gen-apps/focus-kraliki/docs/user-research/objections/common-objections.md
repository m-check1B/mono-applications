## 🚫 PRE-PURCHASE OBJECTIONS

### OBJ-001: "I've tried too many productivity apps already"

**Frequency:** Very High (40% of prospects)
**Emotion:** Fatigue, skepticism, burned before
**Real Quote:** "I've tried Todoist, Asana, Notion, ClickUp, Things... they all failed. Why would this be different?"

**Why It Happens:**
- Productivity app fatigue is real
- Previous tools over-promised, under-delivered
- Feature bloat made them complex
- Required too much manual input

**Effective Responses:**

**❌ Bad Response:**
- "We're better than them!"
- "Just try it, you'll see"
- Listing features they've heard before

**✅ Good Response:**
```
"I totally get it - we've all been burned by productivity apps that promise
everything and deliver nothing. Here's what's actually different about Focus by Kraliki:

1. AI does the work, not you
   - Other apps: You manually organize, categorize, plan
   - Focus by Kraliki: AI generates your schedule, evaluates ideas, finds patterns

2. One unique feature: Shadow Analysis
   - Shows your unconscious productivity patterns
   - Based on Jungian psychology
   - No other app does this

3. Voice-first for zero friction
   - Create tasks while coding/driving/in meetings
   - No app switching, no typing

Try it for 7 days. If you don't see your procrastination patterns
revealed in Shadow Analysis, it's not for you."
```

**Proof Needed:**
- Free 7-day trial (no credit card)
- Show Shadow Analysis demo
- Case study: "I tried 15 apps, this one stuck"

**Conversion Rate:** 35% (with good response)

### OBJ-002: "I don't trust AI with my personal/work data"

**Frequency:** High (25% of prospects)
**Emotion:** Fear, privacy concern, risk-averse
**Real Quote:** "What if AI leaks my client information? What if it's training on my data?"

**Why It Happens:**
- Recent AI privacy scandals in news
- Professional confidentiality concerns (lawyers, consultants)
- General tech skepticism

**Effective Responses:**

**❌ Bad Response:**
- "Don't worry, we're secure"
- Technical jargon about encryption
- "Trust us"

**✅ Good Response:**
```
"Privacy is non-negotiable, especially for professional work. Here's how
Focus by Kraliki protects your data:

1. BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys)
   - Use YOUR own OpenAI/Claude API keys
   - Your data never touches our AI servers
   - You control where data goes

2. Local-first option (coming Q1 2026)
   - All data stays on your device
   - Optional cloud sync
   - Full data export anytime

3. Zero training on your data
   - We don't train models on user data (contractual guarantee)
   - Open-source AI option
   - SOC 2 Type II compliance (in progress)

4. Professional grade security
   - End-to-end encryption
   - Annual security audits
   - GDPR compliant

Many lawyers and consultants use Focus by Kraliki specifically because of BYOK."
```

**Proof Needed:**
- Link to security/privacy page
- Show BYOK setup (takes 2 min)
- Testimonial from lawyer/consultant
- Data export demo

**Conversion Rate:** 60% (with BYOK option)

### OBJ-003: "Too expensive / Can't justify another subscription"

**Frequency:** Very High (35% of prospects)
**Emotion:** Budget-conscious, subscription fatigue
**Real Quote:** "I already pay for Notion ($10), Todoist ($5), Calendly ($12)... can't afford another $20/month"

**Why It Happens:**
- Subscription fatigue (average person has 8-12 subscriptions)
- Unclear ROI
- Tight budgets (especially freelancers)

**Effective Responses:**

**❌ Bad Response:**
- "It's only $20/month"
- "You need to invest in yourself"
- Discount/desperation

**✅ Good Response:**
```
"Let's do the math on what you're actually paying for scattered tools:

Current state (typical):
- Notion: $10/month
- Todoist: $5/month
- Toggl: $9/month
- Calendly: $12/month
Total: $36/month + managing 4 apps

Focus by Kraliki: $20/month (replaces all 4)
Net savings: $16/month = $192/year

But the real ROI:
- Better time tracking = 10-15% more billable hours
- For $60/hour freelancer = $1,200-1,800 more revenue/year
- Time saved not switching apps = 30 min/day = 2.5 hours/week

Plus:
- Free tier available (5 AI requests/day)
- BYOK option (pay only for what you use, ~$5-10/month)
- Cancel anytime, full data export

What's one missed deadline or lost client worth?"
```

**Proof Needed:**
- Cost calculator (interactive)
- ROI case study
- Free tier clear description
- BYOK pricing transparency

**Conversion Rate:** 45% (with ROI framing)

### OBJ-004: "AI is just hype, doesn't actually help productivity"

**Frequency:** Medium (15% of prospects)
**Emotion:** Skepticism, seen too much AI hype
**Real Quote:** "Every app now claims 'AI-powered.' It's just autocomplete. What's actually intelligent here?"

**Why It Happens:**
- AI washing is rampant
- ChatGPT wrapper fatigue
- Want concrete value, not buzzwords

**Effective Responses:**

**❌ Bad Response:**
- "AI is the future!"
- Technical details about models
- Generic "AI helps you be productive"

**✅ Good Response:**
```
"You're right - most 'AI-powered' apps are just ChatGPT wrappers.
Let me show you specific, concrete ways Focus by Kraliki uses AI:

1. Natural Language Parsing (saves 2 min per task)
   - You: 'Review PR #123 tomorrow 3pm high priority'
   - AI extracts: title, date, time, priority, GitHub link
   - Creates task with zero form-filling

2. Shadow Analysis (shows unconscious patterns)
   - Analyzes 30 days of your data
   - Reveals: 'You avoid documentation on Fridays. Here's why...'
   - Jungian psychology framework (not generic tips)

3. Intelligent Scheduling (saves 20 min daily)
   - Knows your energy patterns
   - Considers calendar, deadlines, task dependencies
   - Generates optimal schedule in 3 seconds

Not AI for AI's sake - AI that saves you measurable time.

Try it: Create a task in natural language right now and see."
```

**Proof Needed:**
- Live demo (not video)
- Show Shadow Analysis result
- Timing comparison (AI vs manual)
- Specific time savings data

**Conversion Rate:** 50% (after demo)

### OBJ-005: "I don't need AI, simple task list is enough"

**Frequency:** Medium (20% of prospects)
**Emotion:** Minimalist, skeptical of complexity
**Real Quote:** "I just use Apple Notes and it works fine. Why overcomplicate?"

**Why It Happens:**
- Simplicity preference
- Fear of over-engineering
- Current system "works" (sort of)

**Effective Responses:**

**❌ Bad Response:**
- "Your system is wrong"
- Feature dump
- Complexity sales pitch

**✅ Good Response:**
```
"Simplicity is beautiful - I respect that. And if Apple Notes truly works
for you, keep using it!

But ask yourself honestly:

- Do you ever forget tasks because they're buried in notes?
- Do you struggle to prioritize when everything feels urgent?
- Do you wonder 'what should I work on today?'
- Do you procrastinate and don't know why?

Focus by Kraliki is actually simpler than managing your own system:

Simple task list:
- You decide what's important
- You schedule tasks manually
- You remember context yourself
- You analyze patterns yourself

Focus by Kraliki:
- 'Show me priority tasks for today' → Done
- 'Plan my day' → AI generates optimal schedule
- Voice: 'Add task review code' → Created, no typing
- Shadow Analysis reveals patterns you can't see

It's simpler because AI does the thinking work.

Most 'simple' systems are actually complex - just manual."
```

**Proof Needed:**
- Show "Apple Notes vs Focus by Kraliki" time comparison
- Demo voice capture (ultimate simplicity)
- Testimonial from minimalist user

**Conversion Rate:** 30% (some stay minimal, that's OK)

## 🎓 ONBOARDING OBJECTIONS

### OBJ-006: "Learning curve is too steep / Don't have time to set up"

**Frequency:** High (30% during onboarding)
**Emotion:** Overwhelmed, busy, impatient
**Real Quote:** "I'm too busy to learn another tool. Need something that works immediately."

**Why It Happens:**
- Onboarding flow too long
- Too many features shown at once
- No clear "quick start"

**Effective Responses:**

**❌ Bad Response:**
- "It's easy, just follow these 20 steps"
- Feature tour overload
- "Read the documentation"

**✅ Good Response:**
```
"You're right - you don't have time to learn a complex new tool.

Good news: Focus by Kraliki works in 2 minutes:

Minute 1: Sign up (email or Google)
Minute 2: First task
- Type: 'Show me priority tasks for today'
- AI responds: 'You have no tasks yet. Try creating one!'
- Type: 'Add task finish project proposal by Friday'
- Done. Task created.

That's it. You're productive.

Everything else (Shadow Analysis, workflows, integrations)
you discover as needed. Progressive disclosure.

Want to try? Type one command and see."
```

**Proof Needed:**
- 2-minute onboarding video
- Skip tutorial option
- Progressive feature unlock
- Context-sensitive help

**Conversion Rate:** 70% (complete onboarding)

### OBJ-007: "My workflow is too specific / unique"

**Frequency:** Medium (15% during onboarding)
**Emotion:** Doubt, special snowflake syndrome
**Real Quote:** "I'm a UX designer working with 6 clients in 3 timezones. No generic app can handle that."

**Why It Happens:**
- Actually true - workflows ARE unique
- Fear tool won't adapt
- Previous tools forced their way

**Effective Responses:**

**❌ Bad Response:**
- "Everyone says that, you're not special"
- "Just adapt your workflow"
- Generic reassurance

**✅ Good Response:**
```
"You're absolutely right - your workflow IS unique.

Focus by Kraliki doesn't force a specific workflow. Instead:

1. It learns YOUR patterns
   - How you name tasks
   - Your priority system
   - Your time blocks
   - Your client structure

2. It adapts to YOU
   - Custom fields per project
   - Flexible views (client-based, deadline-based, project-based)
   - Workflow templates you create

3. It fills gaps, not replaces
   - Use Figma for design (we don't replace that)
   - Use Slack for communication (we integrate)
   - Use your brain for creativity (we handle admin)

Example: Maria (UX designer, 6 clients, 3 timezones)
- Setup: 6 projects (one per client)
- Custom field: 'Client Timezone'
- Daily planning accounts for timezone differences
- Time tracking per client for invoicing

Your workflow, AI-enhanced.

What's your specific workflow challenge? Let's solve it."
```

**Proof Needed:**
- Show customization options
- Persona-specific templates
- Integration capabilities
- Success story from similar user

**Conversion Rate:** 65% (with customization demo)

### OBJ-008: "Can I import my existing tasks from [Notion/Todoist/etc]?"

**Frequency:** Medium (20% during onboarding)
**Emotion:** Migration anxiety, sunk cost
**Real Quote:** "I have 500 tasks in Notion. Can't start from scratch."

**Why It Happens:**
- Legitimate concern - existing data
- Fear of losing work
- Migration effort unknown

**Effective Responses:**

**❌ Bad Response:**
- "Just manually copy them over"
- "Start fresh, it's better"
- "We don't support import yet"

**✅ Good Response:**
```
"Absolutely - we support import from:

✅ Notion (CSV export → Focus by Kraliki import)
✅ Todoist (native integration)
✅ Asana (CSV)
✅ Trello (JSON export)
✅ Any CSV file (custom mapping)

Import process (5 minutes):
1. Export from your current tool (they all have export)
2. Upload CSV to Focus by Kraliki
3. Map fields (task name, due date, priority, etc.)
4. Preview import
5. Confirm → All tasks imported

We preserve:
- Task titles and descriptions
- Due dates and priorities
- Project/category structure
- Tags and labels

We DON'T import:
- Comments (can export separately)
- File attachments (re-attach if needed)

500 tasks = 5 minutes to import.

Plus: Keep using old tool for 2 weeks in parallel until comfortable."
```

**Proof Needed:**
- Import guide with screenshots
- Video tutorial
- CSV template
- "Import success" case study

**Conversion Rate:** 85% (with clear import path)

## 🔄 ACTIVE USE OBJECTIONS

### OBJ-009: "AI responses are too slow for daily use"

**Frequency:** Medium (10% active users)
**Emotion:** Impatience, frustration
**Real Quote:** "Waiting 8 seconds for 'What's next?' is too long. I'll just look at my list."

**Why It Happens:**
- Actually slow (some queries)
- Perception vs reality
- No loading state / feedback

**Effective Responses:**

**❌ Bad Response:**
- "AI takes time to think"
- "It's fast enough"
- "Your internet is slow"

**✅ Good Response:**
```
"Speed is critical - we agree. Here's what we're doing:

Current reality:
- Simple queries (list tasks): < 0.5 seconds
- Medium queries (plan day): 3-5 seconds
- Complex queries (Shadow Analysis): 20-30 seconds

Improvements shipping this month:
1. Aggressive caching (30% faster)
2. Predictive loading (loads before you ask)
3. Progressive results (show partial results immediately)
4. Keyboard shortcuts (skip AI for common actions)

Workaround now:
- 'Show tasks' instead of 'What should I work on?' (instant)
- Use manual views for quick reference
- Let AI handle complex questions only

We're measuring every query and optimizing slowest 10%.

What specific queries are slow for you? We'll prioritize those."
```

**Proof Needed:**
- Performance dashboard (public)
- Show caching in action
- Keyboard shortcuts list
- Roadmap for speed improvements

**Retention Impact:** High (if not addressed, 30% churn risk)

### OBJ-010: "Missing [critical feature] that [competitor] has"

**Frequency:** Medium (15% active users)
**Emotion:** Disappointment, comparison
**Real Quote:** "Motion has time-blocking calendar view. Why don't you?"

**Why It Happens:**
- Feature comparison shopping
- Genuinely missing feature they need
- Grass-is-greener syndrome

**Effective Responses:**

**❌ Bad Response:**
- "We'll add it soon" (vague promise)
- "That feature isn't important"
- Defensive

**✅ Good Response:**
```
"Great question - let me explain our approach:

We intentionally launched without [time-blocking calendar] because:

1. We wanted to nail core AI features first
   - Shadow Analysis (unique to us)
   - Natural language parsing
   - Intelligent scheduling

2. Feature vs. maintenance tradeoff
   - Better to have 10 excellent features
   - Than 50 half-baked features

That said, [time-blocking calendar] IS on our roadmap:
- Planned: Q1 2026
- Status: Design phase
- Preview: [show mockup]

Why wait? Honest answer:
- Need to integrate with calendar sync first (shipping Week 4)
- Want AI to auto-suggest time blocks (not manual drag-drop)
- Building it right, not fast

In the meantime:
- Use Google Calendar integration (shipping Week 4)
- AI daily planning gives similar outcome
- Or, use both tools (we integrate)

Vote for this feature in our roadmap to prioritize it."
```

**Proof Needed:**
- Public roadmap with voting
- Show feature in progress (screenshot/mockup)
- Workaround guide
- ETA commitment (if realistic)

**Retention Impact:** Medium (depends on feature criticality)

### OBJ-011: "Voice transcription makes mistakes"

**Frequency:** Low (5% active users, but vocal)
**Emotion:** Frustration, loss of trust
**Real Quote:** "It turned 'Client meeting with John Smith' into 'Client meeting with Joan's myth.' Embarrassing."

**Why It Happens:**
- Transcription accuracy ~90-95% (not 100%)
- Names, technical terms, accents challenging
- No editing before save

**Effective Responses:**

**❌ Bad Response:**
- "Just edit it after"
- "AI isn't perfect"
- "Speak clearly"

**✅ Good Response:**
```
"You're absolutely right - that's unacceptable for professional work.

We're fixing this:

Immediate (available now):
1. Edit-before-save option (Settings → Voice → Confirm before saving)
2. Custom vocabulary (add client names, tech terms)
3. Confidence score (if < 80%, asks you to confirm)

Shipping this month:
1. Learn from corrections (next time 'Joan's myth' → 'John Smith')
2. Context-aware (knows your client names)
3. Better models (switching to Deepgram for 97% accuracy)

Long-term:
- Train on your voice specifically
- Domain-specific models (design, dev, consulting)

Workaround now:
- Use text for critical information
- Voice for quick captures only
- Always review before sharing externally

We track every correction you make and prioritize fixes.

Sorry for the frustration. Can we make it right?"
```

**Proof Needed:**
- Show custom vocabulary feature
- Accuracy improvement graph
- User corrections dashboard
- Roadmap for improvements

**Retention Impact:** Low (but annoying when it happens)
