# The AI Toolbelt

Welcome to AI Academy Level 2: AI Pro.

In Level 1, you learned to communicate with AI using the RTC framework and apply it to everyday tasks.

Now we're going deeper. You're going to build a **complete AI toolbelt** - a set of specialized tools, each with its own superpower, working together to make you unstoppable.

## The Tool Selection Problem

Most people use ChatGPT for everything.

That's like using a hammer for every job. It works... sometimes. But you're missing the power of purpose-built tools.

The best AI users know:
- **Which tool** for which job
- **How to combine** tools in workflows
- **When to switch** between tools

By the end of this module, you'll have a mental framework for tool selection that makes every decision instant.

## Your AI Toolbelt Overview

| Tool | Superpower | Best For |
|------|------------|----------|
| **ChatGPT** | General reasoning, conversation | Writing, brainstorming, explanation |
| **Claude** | Deep thinking, nuanced analysis | Complex problems, long documents, ethics |
| **Perplexity** | Real-time research with sources | Research, current events, fact-checking |
| **Midjourney** | Image generation | Visuals, mockups, creative concepts |
| **Cursor** | AI-assisted coding | Writing and editing code |
| **Voice Mode** | Hands-free interaction | Brainstorming, dictation, accessibility |

## The Tool Selection Matrix

When deciding which tool to use, ask:

### Question 1: Do I need current information?
- **Yes** --> Perplexity (searches the web)
- **No** --> Continue to Question 2

### Question 2: Is this about code?
- **Yes** --> Cursor
- **No** --> Continue to Question 3

### Question 3: Do I need images?
- **Yes** --> Midjourney
- **No** --> Continue to Question 4

### Question 4: Is this a complex, nuanced problem?
- **Yes** --> Claude (better at reasoning)
- **No** --> ChatGPT (faster, good enough)

### Question 5: Am I mobile or hands-free?
- **Yes** --> Voice Mode (any major AI)
- **No** --> Text interface

## Building Your Personal Toolbelt

### Step 1: Access Each Tool
Get accounts for:
- ChatGPT (free tier to start)
- Claude (free tier available)
- Perplexity (free tier available)
- Midjourney (paid, ~$10/month)
- Cursor (free tier available)

### Step 2: Try Each on the Same Task
Take one task (e.g., "explain blockchain") and run it through each tool. Notice the differences.

### Step 3: Identify Your Patterns
Track which tool you reach for most. Is it the right one, or just habit?

### Step 4: Build Muscle Memory
Practice tool selection until it becomes automatic.
