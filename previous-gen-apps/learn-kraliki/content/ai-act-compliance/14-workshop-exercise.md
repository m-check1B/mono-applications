## Part 1: AI System Inventory

### Worksheet A: AI System Inventory

For each AI system in your organization, complete:

| # | System Name | Purpose | Department | Deployed | Users | Notes |
|---|-------------|---------|-------------|-----------|-------|-------|
| 1 | | | | | |
| 2 | | | | | |
| 3 | | | | | |
| 4 | | | | | |
| 5 | | | | | |
| 6 | | | | | |

| 9 | | | | | |
| 10| | | | | |

**Tips for Completing Inventory:**
- Walk through each business process
- Check with IT, data science, and business teams
- Review software vendors and tools
- Don't forget: Chatbots, analytics tools, recommendation engines, predictive models

## Part 2: Risk Classification

### Worksheet B: Risk Classification Matrix

For each AI system from your inventory, classify its risk level:

### Decision Tree

**Start:** What does your AI system do?

**Question 1:** Is it one of the prohibited uses?
- Social scoring?
- Real-time biometric ID in public?
- Predictive policing?
- Emotion recognition in workplace/education?
- Exploiting vulnerabilities?

**YES** → **PROHIBITED** - Stop using immediately!

**NO** → Continue to Question 2

---

**Question 2:** Is it listed in Annex III (high-risk use cases)?
- Biometrics in law enforcement?
- Critical infrastructure management?
- Education or vocational training?
- Employment (recruitment, worker management)?
- Access to essential services (healthcare, banking)?
- Law enforcement assistance?
- Migration, asylum, border control?
- Administration of justice?

**YES** → **HIGH-RISK** - Requires full compliance

**NO** → Continue to Question 3

---

**Question 3:** Does it require transparency to users?
- Chatbot or virtual assistant?
- AI-generated content (deepfakes)?
- Emotion recognition (outside workplace/education)?
- Biometric categorization?

**YES** → **LIMITED-RISK** - Transparency obligations only

**NO** → **MINIMAL-RISK** - No specific requirements

### Worksheet B: Classification Results

| System | Q1 Prohibited? | Q2 High-Risk? | Q3 Limited-Risk? | Classification |
|---------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| 1 | | | | |
| 2 | | | | |
| 3 | | | | |
| 4 | | | | |
| 5 | | | | |
| 6 | | | | |
| 7 | | | | |
| 8 | | | | |
| 9 | | | | |
| 10| | | | |

## Part 3: Gap Analysis

### Worksheet C: High-Risk Systems Gap Analysis

For each HIGH-RISK system, assess compliance with the 10 mandatory requirements:

| Requirement | System 1 | System 2 | System 3 |
|-------------|----------|----------|----------|
| 1. Risk Management System | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
| 2. High-Quality Data | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
| 3. Technical Documentation | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
| 4. Record-Keeping | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
| 5. Transparency | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
| 6. Human Oversight | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
| 7. Accuracy, Robustness, Cybersecurity | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
| 8. Conformity Assessment | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
| 9. Quality Management System | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
| 10. Post-Market Monitoring | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No |

**Gap Score:** Count "No" responses
- **0-2 gaps:** Well-positioned
- **3-5 gaps:** Moderate work required
- **6-10 gaps:** Significant effort needed

---

### Worksheet D: Limited-Risk Systems Gap Analysis

For each LIMITED-RISK system, assess transparency compliance:

| System | AI Disclosure | Human Available | Documented |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| 1 | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
| 2 | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
| 3 | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No |
| 4 | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No | [ ] Yes [ ] No |

---

## Part 4: Priority Scoring

### Worksheet E: Action Priority Matrix

For each system needing work, calculate priority score:

| System | Risk Level | Gap Severity | Business Impact | Deadline Urgency | Total (1-5 each) | Priority |
|---------|------------|--------------|----------------|------------------|-------------------|----------|
| 1 | H/M/L | Critical/High/Med | High/Med/Low | <3mo / 3-6mo / 6-12mo | ___/20 | |
| 2 | | | | | ___/20 | |
| 3 | | | | | ___/20 | |
| 4 | | | | | ___/20 | |

**Scoring:**
- **Risk Level:** H=5, M=3, L=1
- **Gap Severity:** Critical=5, High=3, Medium=1
- **Business Impact:** High=5, Medium=3, Low=1
- **Deadline Urgency:** <3mo=5, 3-6mo=3, 6-12mo=1

**Total Score:** Sum all columns (max 20)

**Priority Ranking:**
- **15-20:** Immediate action (within 30 days)
- **10-14:** High priority (within 90 days)
- **5-9:** Medium priority (within 6 months)
- **<5:** Low priority (within 12 months)
