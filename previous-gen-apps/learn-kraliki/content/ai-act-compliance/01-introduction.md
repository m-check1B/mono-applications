# Introduction to the EU AI Act

## Overview

The European Union AI Act is a comprehensive regulatory framework that governs the development and use of artificial intelligence within the EU. It became enforceable on February 2, 2025, and has significant implications for businesses operating in or serving the European market.

## Why This Matters

### Financial Impact
Non-compliance with the AI Act carries severe penalties:
- **Up to €30 million in fines**
- **Or 6% of global annual revenue** (whichever is higher)

For most SMEs and mid-market companies, these fines could be business-ending.

### Business Opportunity
- **82% of Czech AI adopters report revenue growth**
- Compliance creates a competitive advantage
- Early adopters gain market trust and regulatory certainty

## Scope of the AI Act

### Who It Applies To

The AI Act applies to:
- **Providers** of AI systems (companies developing AI)
- **Deployers** of AI systems (companies using AI)
- **Importers and distributors** of AI systems
- **Product manufacturers** integrating AI
- **Authorized representatives** of non-EU providers

### Geographic Reach

The AI Act has **extraterritorial effect**:
- Applies to providers/deployers **outside the EU** if their AI systems are used in the EU
- Similar to GDPR's "Brussels effect"

## Key Principles

1. **Risk-based approach** - Regulations scale with AI system risk
2. **Prohibited practices** - Certain AI uses are banned outright
3. **High-risk systems** - Strict requirements for specific applications
4. **Transparency obligations** - Users must know when interacting with AI
5. **Market surveillance** - Ongoing monitoring and enforcement
