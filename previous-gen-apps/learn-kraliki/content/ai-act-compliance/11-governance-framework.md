# Building Your Governance Framework

## What is AI Governance?

AI governance is the **system of policies, processes, and structures** that ensures your organization's AI systems are developed, deployed, and used responsibly and compliantly.

## Why Governance Matters

Without proper governance:
- Risk of non-compliance and fines (up to €30M)
- Inconsistent AI practices across departments
- Uncontrolled AI adoption
- Reputational damage from AI failures
- Legal liability for AI-caused harm

With effective governance:
- Confident AI deployment
- Regulatory compliance assured
- Stakeholder trust maintained
- Competitive advantage
- Sustainable AI innovation

5. Resource allocation

#### Development Workflow
1. Requirements gathering
2. Risk assessment
3. Control implementation
4. Documentation creation
5. Testing and validation
6. Compliance review
7. Deployment approval

#### Deployment Process
1. Conformity assessment (high-risk)
2. Internal sign-off
3. User training
4. Monitoring activation
5. Go-live
6. Post-deployment review

#### Change Management
1. Change request submitted
2. Impact assessment

### 4. Controls and Mechanisms

#### Preventive Controls
- **Risk assessments** before deployment
- **Approvals** for high-risk projects
- **Development procedures** with checkpoints
- **Training** for all AI developers
- **Standards** and templates

#### Detective Controls
- **Monitoring dashboards** for performance
- **Automated alerts** for anomalies
- **Regular audits** of compliance
- **User feedback systems**
- **Performance reviews**

#### Corrective Controls
- **Incident response procedures**
- **Rollback mechanisms**
- **Corrective action processes**
- **Root cause analysis**
- **Continuous improvement**

### 5. Monitoring and Reporting

#### Compliance Monitoring
- **Daily:** Automated system monitoring
- **Weekly:** Performance dashboards review
- **Monthly:** Compliance status report
- **Quarterly:** Risk reassessment
- **Annually:** External audit

#### Reporting Structure
```
AI Development Teams
        ↓ (Weekly reports)
    AI Compliance Lead
        ↓ (Monthly reports)
    Governance Committee
        ↓ (Quarterly reports)
    Board of Directors
```

#### Key Metrics to Track
- Number of AI systems by risk category
- Compliance percentage
- Incidents and near-misses

- **Support:** Resource allocation decisions

#### Staff Training
- **All staff:** AI Act awareness (1 hour)
- **Developers:** Technical compliance (4 hours)
- **Operators:** System procedures (2 hours)
- **Management:** Risk and oversight (2 hours)
- **Refreshers:** Annual updates

#### Ethical Culture
- Promote responsible AI development
- Encourage transparency and accountability
- Reward compliance and best practices
- Learn from incidents and near-misses

## Governance Maturity Model

| Maturity Level | Characteristics |
|---------------|-----------------|
| **Initial** | Ad-hoc AI use, no governance |
| **Developing** | Basic policies, informal processes |
| **Defined** | Formal policies, documented processes |
| **Managed** | Measurable compliance, proactive monitoring |
| **Optimizing** | Continuous improvement, best-in-class |

## Common Governance Pitfalls

### Don't Do This
- ❌ Create governance without resources
- ❌ Have policies without enforcement
- ❌ Assign governance as side job
- ❌ Treat governance as one-time project
- ❌ Ignore governance for "quick wins"

### Do This Instead
- ✅ Allocate dedicated resources
- ✅ Enforce policies consistently
- ✅ Appoint accountable owners
- ✅ Treat governance as ongoing program
- ✅ Apply governance to all AI projects
