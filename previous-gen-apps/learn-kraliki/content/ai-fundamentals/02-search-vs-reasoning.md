# Search vs Reasoning: Google vs AI

For the last 20 years, we've been trained to use the internet in one specific way:

1. We have a question
2. We type keywords into a box
3. We get a list of links
4. We click, we read, we hunt for the answer

We call this **"Search"**.

The biggest mistake beginners make with AI is treating it like Google. They type "Capital of France" and get "Paris". And they think, "So what? Google does that."

But AI isn't a better Search Engine. It's a **Reasoning Engine**.

## The Chef vs. The Librarian

Think of **Google as a Librarian**:
- You ask for a book on Italian cooking
- The Librarian points to the shelf
- You go get the book, open it, find the recipe
- You cook the meal yourself

Think of **AI as a Chef**:
- You don't ask the Chef for a *book* about cooking
- You say, "I have tomatoes, basil, and pasta. What can I make?"
- The Chef doesn't give you a link to a recipe
- The Chef *creates* a plan for you right there

| Librarian (Google) | Chef (AI) |
|-------------------|-----------|
| Retrieves information | Generates solutions |
| Points to sources | Synthesizes answers |
| You do the work | It does the draft |
| Keyword-based | Conversation-based |

## When to Use Which?

Google isn't dead. It's just a different tool for different jobs.

### Use Google When You Need a FACT

- "What is the stock price of Apple right now?"
- "Who won the 1998 World Cup?"
- "What time does the pharmacy close?"

Real-time information, current events, and verifiable facts are Google's domain.

### Use AI When You Need a TASK

- "Draft an email to my boss asking for a raise"
- "Summarize this 10-page report"
- "Plan a 3-day trip to Rome for a family with kids"
- "Explain quantum physics like I'm five"
- "Help me brainstorm names for my new business"

**Google finds information. AI does something with information.**

## The Real Power: Synthesis

Here's what sets AI apart:

**Google Query:** "best restaurants Rome family friendly"
**Result:** 10 links to blog posts you must read and compare

**AI Query:** "I'm traveling to Rome with two kids under 10. We need 3 restaurant recommendations near the Colosseum. Kids are picky eaters. Budget is moderate."
**Result:** A curated list with reasoning, alternatives, and tips

The AI doesn't just search - it combines multiple pieces of information into a coherent answer tailored to YOUR situation.

## The Shift in Thinking

| Search Thinking | Reasoning Thinking |
|----------------|-------------------|
| "Find me an answer" | "Help me solve this" |
| Keywords | Full sentences |
| One query | Conversation |
| Browse results | Refine together |
| You compile | It synthesizes |

## Real Examples

### Example 1: Job Application

**Search Approach:**
1. Google "cover letter examples"
2. Read 5 articles
3. Download a template
4. Modify it yourself
5. Time: 1-2 hours

**Reasoning Approach:**
1. Give AI your resume
2. Give AI the job description
3. Ask: "Write a cover letter highlighting my leadership skills"
4. Review and refine
5. Time: 10-15 minutes

### Example 2: Research

**Search Approach:**
1. Google "renewable energy trends 2025"
2. Open 10 tabs
3. Read each article
4. Take notes
5. Synthesize yourself
6. Time: 2-3 hours

**Reasoning Approach:**
1. Ask AI: "What are the top 5 renewable energy trends for 2025? Include statistics and cite sources if possible."
2. Ask follow-up questions
3. Request a summary
4. Time: 15-30 minutes

> **Note:** Always verify AI-generated facts with authoritative sources. AI is a starting point, not the final word.

## Practice: Transform Your Queries

Take your usual Google searches and transform them:

| Google Query | AI Conversation |
|-------------|-----------------|
| "healthy dinner recipes" | "I have chicken, broccoli, and rice. Give me 3 healthy dinner options that take under 30 minutes." |
| "how to negotiate salary" | "I have a job offer for $80K. My research shows the range is $85-95K. Help me draft a negotiation email that's professional but firm." |
| "excel formulas" | "I have a spreadsheet with sales data. I need to calculate total revenue by region and show month-over-month growth. What formulas do I need?" |

## The Mindset Summary

1. **Stop asking questions you could find on Wikipedia**
2. **Start asking AI to do work**
3. **Provide context - the more specific, the better**
4. **Think conversation, not query**
5. **Iterate and refine**

## Exercise: Your First Reasoning Task

Try this now:

1. Think of a task that usually takes you 30+ minutes
2. Instead of searching, ask AI to help you complete it
3. Notice the difference in the type of result you get

Example task ideas:
- Writing a thank-you note
- Planning a meeting agenda
- Explaining a concept to someone
- Organizing a list of priorities

## What's Next?

Now that you understand the difference between Search and Reasoning, it's time to tackle the elephant in the room: **Fear**.

In the next lesson, we'll address the question everyone is secretly asking: "Is this thing going to take my job?"
