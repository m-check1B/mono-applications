# Exercise: Your Perfect Prompt

This is the hands-on lesson. No more theory.

By the end of this exercise, you'll have created a prompt that saves you real time on a real task.

## Your Mission

Create a **reusable prompt** for a task you do regularly - something that takes 30+ minutes that could be reduced to 10 minutes or less.

---

## Step 1: Identify Your Task

Pick a task you do weekly (or more often):

**Common candidates:**
- Writing status update emails
- Summarizing meeting notes
- Creating agendas
- Drafting client responses
- Writing social media posts
- Preparing presentation outlines
- Creating to-do lists from messy notes
- Writing product descriptions
- Drafting proposals
- Explaining technical concepts to non-technical people

**Your Task:** ________________________________

**How often do you do this?** ________________________________

**How long does it usually take?** ________________________________

---

## Step 2: Apply the RTC Framework

Now, build your prompt piece by piece.

### Part A: Define the Role

Who would be the ideal expert to help with this task?

```
You are a ________________________________
with ________________________________ experience in ________________________________.
```

**Tips:**
- Be specific about expertise level
- Include relevant specialty
- Think about the best person in the world for this task

### Part B: Define the Task

What exactly do you need the AI to do?

```
I need you to ________________________________.

Format: ________________________________
Length: ________________________________
Tone: ________________________________
Structure: ________________________________
```

**Tips:**
- Use action verbs (write, create, summarize, analyze)
- Specify output format clearly
- Include any must-haves

### Part C: Provide Context

What does the AI need to know about your situation?

```
Background: ________________________________

Audience: ________________________________

Purpose: ________________________________

Constraints: ________________________________

Examples/References: ________________________________
```

**Tips:**
- Include anything that would help someone unfamiliar with your situation
- Mention what to avoid
- Provide examples of good output if available

---

## Step 3: Write Your Complete Prompt

Combine all three parts:

```
[ROLE]
You are a ________________________________
with ________________________________ experience in ________________________________.

[TASK]
I need you to ________________________________.
Format: ________________________________
Length: ________________________________
Tone: ________________________________

[CONTEXT]
Background: ________________________________
Audience: ________________________________
Purpose: ________________________________
Constraints: ________________________________
```

---

## Step 4: Test and Iterate

Now test your prompt with a real example:

1. **Run it** - Copy your prompt into ChatGPT, Claude, or your preferred AI
2. **Evaluate** - Is the output close to what you need?
3. **Note problems** - What's wrong? Too formal? Too long? Missing key info?
4. **Iterate** - Use the techniques from Lesson 5 to refine
5. **Repeat** until you get consistent good output

---

## Step 5: Create Variations

Once your base prompt works, create variations for different scenarios:

### Variation A: Different Audiences
Same task but for different recipients (e.g., client vs. boss vs. colleague)

### Variation B: Different Lengths
Quick version vs. detailed version

### Variation C: Different Tones
Formal version vs. casual version

---

## Example: Complete Prompt Build

Let's walk through a full example.

**Task:** Weekly team status email

### Before (Weak Prompt):
> "Write a status update email."

### After (Perfect Prompt):

```
[ROLE]
You are an experienced project manager who excels at clear,
concise communication with stakeholders.

[TASK]
Write a weekly status update email for my team's projects.

Format:
- Subject line
- 2-3 sentence overview
- Bullet points for: Completed This Week, In Progress, Blockers
- Next week's priorities (3 items max)
- Closing line

Length: Under 250 words total
Tone: Professional but warm, action-oriented

[CONTEXT]
Background: I manage a 5-person software development team
building a customer portal. We work in 2-week sprints.

Audience: My direct manager and 2 stakeholders from the
business side who don't understand technical details.

Purpose: Keep stakeholders informed without requiring
a meeting. Highlight any blockers early.

Constraints:
- Avoid technical jargon
- Always mention any risks or blockers prominently
- End with a clear statement of next week's priority

This week's updates to include:
[I paste my raw notes here each week]
```

### How to Use This Prompt Weekly:
1. Keep the prompt saved
2. Update only the "This week's updates" section
3. Run and review
4. Send in 5 minutes instead of 30

## Step 6: Save Your Prompts

Store your proven prompts for reuse:

**Options:**
- Notes app with a "Prompts" folder
- Document with categories
- Custom GPT (if using ChatGPT Plus)
- Snippet manager (TextExpander, Espanso, etc.)

**Naming Convention:**
```
[Task] - [Audience] - [Version]
Examples:
- Status Email - Manager - v2
- Meeting Agenda - Client - Formal
- Blog Post - LinkedIn - Short
```
