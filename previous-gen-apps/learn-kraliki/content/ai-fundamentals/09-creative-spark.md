# Creative Spark

"I don't know where to start."

The blank page. The empty document. The cursor blinking, mocking you.

This is where most people get stuck. Not because they lack ideas, but because getting started is the hardest part.

AI doesn't replace your creativity. It **ignites** it.

## How AI Boosts Creativity

Common misconception: "AI-generated content isn't creative."

Reality: AI is a **creative catalyst**:
- It generates options you haven't considered
- It breaks you out of habitual thinking
- It provides raw material for your refinement
- It removes the "blank page" problem

Your job isn't to accept AI output as-is. Your job is to **react, select, combine, and improve**.

## Use Case 1: Brainstorming Quantity

When you need lots of ideas, fast:

### The Prompt Template
```
Brainstorm 20 ideas for [topic].

Don't filter - include wild ideas, obvious ideas,
and everything in between.

Context: [what this is for]
Constraints: [any limitations]
```

### Why 20?
- First 5 ideas: Obvious (everyone thinks of these)
- Ideas 6-15: Interesting (where good ideas live)
- Ideas 16-20: Unexpected (where great ideas hide)

### Example: Gift Ideas
```
Brainstorm 20 gift ideas for my dad's 60th birthday.

Context:
- He likes golf, history books, and bourbon
- Budget: $50-150
- He says "I have everything I need"
- We're not very sentimental in our family

Include some unexpected options.
```

---

## Use Case 2: Breaking Constraints

When your thinking is stuck in a box:

### The Prompt Template
```
I'm trying to [goal] but I'm stuck because [constraint].

Challenge my assumptions. What would happen if:
- The constraint didn't exist?
- We did the opposite?
- We combined this with something unexpected?

Give me 5 unconventional approaches.
```

### Example: Marketing on Zero Budget
```
I need to promote my bakery but I have no marketing budget.

Challenge my assumptions:
- What if "no budget" is actually an advantage?
- What's something competitors with big budgets CAN'T do?
- What would a 10-year-old suggest?

Give me 5 unconventional approaches.
```

## Use Case 3: Creative Frameworks

Apply structured creative techniques:

### SCAMPER Method
```
Apply the SCAMPER technique to [product/idea]:

S - Substitute: What can I replace?
C - Combine: What can I merge together?
A - Adapt: What could I copy from elsewhere?
M - Modify: What can I change?
P - Put to other use: New application?
E - Eliminate: What can I remove?
R - Rearrange: Different order or layout?
```

### Random Combination
```
Combine these unrelated concepts and show me
what new ideas emerge:

Concept 1: [first thing]
Concept 2: [unrelated second thing]

Give me 5 combinations that could be products,
services, or creative projects.
```

### Reverse Engineering
```
If [desired outcome] already existed and was
hugely successful, what would it look like?

Now work backwards: what steps would have
led to that success?
```

## Use Case 4: Content Ideas

```

For each day:
- Content type (image, video, text)
- Main message

```

### Newsletter Ideas
```
Give me 4 newsletter topic ideas for [audience].

Each should:
- Solve a real problem they have

```

---

## Use Case 5: Names and Titles

The hardest creative task: naming things.

Requirements:
- Easy to spell and pronounce
- Available as .com domain (I'll check)
- Evokes [feelings/concepts]

Include: Made-up words, real word combinations,
metaphors, and acronyms.
```

## Use Case 6: Overcoming Writer's Block

When you can't get started:

### The Messy First Draft
```
I need to write about [topic] but I can't start.

Just start writing a rough draft. It doesn't have
to be good. Stream of consciousness is fine.

I'll use this as a starting point to edit.

Key points to include: [list]
```

### Multiple Angles
```
I want to write about [topic].

Give me 5 different ways to approach this:
- A personal story angle
- A data/research angle
- A contrarian take
- A practical how-to
- A future prediction

I'll pick the one that excites me.
```

### Finish My Thought
```
I started writing this but got stuck:

[paste your beginning]

Continue this in the same voice and direction.
Give me 3 possible next paragraphs to choose from.
```
