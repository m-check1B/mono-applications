# Iteration and Context: Refining AI Outputs

You've written a great RTC prompt. You hit enter.

The response comes back and... it's close, but not quite right.

Now what?

Do you start over with a completely new prompt?

**No.**

This is where iteration becomes your superpower.

## The Conversation Advantage

Unlike a Google search, AI remembers what you discussed. This is called **context**.

Every message you send adds to the context window. The AI carries forward:
- What you asked
- What it answered
- Any corrections you made
- Any preferences you stated

This means you can **refine** without repeating yourself.

## Iteration Strategies

### Strategy 1: The Direct Correction

When the output is wrong in a specific way, just say so.

```
Your response: [AI gives you a formal email]
Your follow-up: "Make this more casual and friendly.
We've worked together for years."
```

The AI adjusts while keeping everything else.

### Strategy 2: The Specific Request

When you need to add or change something specific:

```
Your response: [AI gives you a product description]
Your follow-up: "Good, but add a section about
the 30-day money-back guarantee."
```

### Strategy 3: The Format Shift

When the content is right but the format is wrong:

```
Your response: [AI gives you paragraphs]
Your follow-up: "Convert this into a bulleted list
with headers for each main point."
```

### Strategy 4: The Persona Shift

When the tone doesn't match:

```
Your response: [AI sounds too corporate]
Your follow-up: "Rewrite this as if you're
explaining to a friend over coffee."
```

### Strategy 5: The Length Adjustment

When it's too long or too short:

```
"This is too long. Cut it to 3 paragraphs max."
"Can you expand on point 2? Give me more detail."
```

## The Critique Loop

Here's an advanced technique: Use one response to improve another.

### Step 1: Generate First Draft
"Write a cold email for my consulting services."

### Step 2: Ask for Critique
"Now pretend you're the recipient. What would make you ignore this email?"

### Step 3: Improve Based on Critique
"Good points. Now rewrite the email addressing those issues."

This self-critique approach often produces better results than just asking for "the best version."

## Context Building Examples

### Example 1: Progressive Refinement

```
You: Write a LinkedIn post about AI in business.

AI: [Writes generic post]

You: Good start, but make it more provocative.
     Start with a counterintuitive hook.

AI: [Revises with hook]

You: Better. Now add a personal anecdote about
     a time AI surprised me at work.

AI: [Adds anecdote placeholder]

You: Here's the actual story: [shares story].
     Weave this in naturally.

AI: [Produces polished final version]
```

Four iterations, each building on the last.

### Example 2: Establishing Ongoing Context

```
You: I run a small marketing agency with 5 employees.
     We specialize in B2B SaaS companies. Our clients
     are usually 50-200 person startups.

AI: [Acknowledges]

You: For the rest of this conversation, keep that
     context in mind when giving advice.

AI: [Confirms]

You: What's the best way to price a website redesign project?

AI: [Gives advice tailored to your specific situation]
```

By establishing context once, every following question becomes more relevant.

## When to Start Over vs. Iterate

### Keep Iterating When:
- The direction is right, just needs tweaking
- You've invested context that's valuable
- Small adjustments will get you there
- The AI is "in the zone" with your style

### Start Fresh When:
- The fundamental approach is wrong
- You need a completely different angle
- The context has become confusing
- You're getting repetitive responses

## Power Phrases for Iteration

Keep these in your back pocket:

| Situation | Power Phrase |
|-----------|--------------|
| Too formal | "Make it more conversational" |
| Too casual | "Make it more professional" |
| Too long | "Cut this in half" |
| Too short | "Expand on this with examples" |
| Wrong angle | "Take a different approach. Try..." |
| Missing info | "Add a section about..." |
| Too complex | "Simplify this for a beginner" |
| Too simple | "Add more depth and nuance" |
| Generic | "Make this more specific to [context]" |
| Not actionable | "Add concrete next steps" |

## The Memory Limitation

Important caveat: AI memory has limits.

- Most AIs have a "context window" (e.g., 8K, 32K, 128K tokens)
- Very long conversations may "forget" early context
- When this happens, you may need to remind the AI of key points

Signs the AI has lost context:
- Repeating information it already gave
- Contradicting earlier statements
- Reverting to generic responses
- Asking questions you already answered

Fix: Remind it of the key context:
> "Remember, we're writing for [audience] and the goal is [goal]."

## Building Your Personal Style

Over time, you can train the AI to match your voice:

### Method 1: Feed Examples
```
"Here are 3 emails I've written. Study my style:
[paste examples]
Now write a new email matching this voice."
```

### Method 2: Define Your Rules
```
"My writing style rules:
- Short sentences
- No jargon
- Always end with a clear action
- Use 'you' more than 'I'
Follow these in all responses."
```

### Method 3: Correct Consistently
When the AI gets your style wrong, correct it every time. It learns.

## Exercise: Iteration Practice

Try this exercise:

1. Ask AI to write a paragraph about your job
2. Whatever it produces, ask for 3 improvements
3. Then ask it to critique its own work
4. Then ask it to improve based on that critique
5. Compare version 1 to version 5

Notice how each iteration gets closer to what you actually want.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Don't start over** - iterate on what you have
2. **Be specific** about what to change
3. **Build context** progressively
4. **Use critique loops** for better results
5. **Know when to restart** (fundamental problems)
6. **Establish ongoing context** for efficiency

## What's Next?

You've learned to communicate with AI using RTC, and to refine outputs through iteration.

In the next lesson, we'll put it all together with a hands-on exercise: crafting your **Perfect Prompt** for a real task you face every day.
