# The Email Assistant

Welcome to Module 3: Everyday Magic.

In this module, we take everything you've learned and apply it to real, practical use cases you'll use every single day.

Let's start with the task that consumes more time than almost any other in modern work: **email**.

## The Email Problem

The average professional:
- Spends 2.5 hours per day on email
- Receives 120+ emails daily
- Writes 40+ emails per day
- Stares at a blank screen wondering how to start

What if you could:
- Draft responses in 30 seconds
- Handle "difficult" emails with confidence
- Never struggle with tone again
- Process your inbox in half the time?

That's what we're building.

## Use Case 1: Drafting from Scratch

When you need to write an email from nothing:

### The Prompt Template
```
You are a professional communication expert.

Write an email to [recipient] about [topic].
- Purpose: [what you want to achieve]
- Tone: [formal/casual/friendly/firm]
- Length: [short/medium]
- Key points: [what must be included]
- Relationship: [how well you know them]
```

### Example: Requesting a Meeting
```
Write an email to my client Sarah asking to schedule
a quarterly review meeting.

- Purpose: Get a 30-minute meeting on their calendar
- Tone: Professional but warm (we've worked together 2 years)
- Length: Short (3-4 sentences max)
- Key points: Q4 results to discuss, 2025 planning
- Include: Suggest 3 time slots next week
```

### Result:
A complete, send-ready email in 10 seconds.

## Use Case 2: Replying to Difficult Emails

Those emails that sit in your inbox for days because you don't know how to respond.

### The Prompt Template
```
I received this email:
[paste the email]

Help me respond. The situation is:
[explain any context they need]

My goals are:
- [what you want to achieve]
- [how you want to come across]

Constraints:
- [things to avoid saying]
- [relationship considerations]
```

### Example: Declining a Request
```
I received this email:
"Hi! Would you be able to join our committee for the
annual conference? It would be about 10 hours of your
time over the next 3 months."

Help me respond. The situation is:
- This is a colleague I respect
- I genuinely can't take this on right now
- I want to maintain the relationship
- I might want to help next year

My goals are:
- Decline clearly (no maybes)
- Express genuine appreciation
- Leave the door open for future

Constraints:
- Don't over-explain or apologize too much
- Don't suggest alternatives that create work for me
```

## Use Case 3: Tone Shifting

You've written an email, but the tone isn't right.

### The Prompt Template
```
Rewrite this email to be more [desired tone]:

[paste your email]

Keep the same information but adjust the voice.
```

### Common Tone Shifts

| From | To | Use When |
|------|-----|----------|
| Formal | Casual | Writing to a friend/close colleague |
| Casual | Formal | Escalating to leadership |
| Passive | Direct | Getting ignored |
| Harsh | Diplomatic | Delivering bad news |
| Wordy | Concise | Respecting their time |
| Cold | Warm | Building relationship |

### Example: Diplomatic Bad News
```
Rewrite this email to be more diplomatic:

"We can't meet your deadline. The project is taking
longer than expected. You'll need to adjust your
timeline."

Same information, but softer and more professional.
Also suggest a solution.
```

## Use Case 4: Summarizing Long Threads

When you're CC'd on a 47-email chain and need to catch up:

### The Prompt Template
```
Summarize this email thread:

[paste the thread]

Tell me:
1. What is this about? (1 sentence)
2. Key decisions made
3. Open questions/conflicts
4. What (if anything) do I need to do?
```

### Pro Tip: Thread Digests
Run this prompt on long threads before meetings:
```
Create a 30-second briefing I can read before the meeting:
- Who are the key players and their positions?
- What's the core disagreement?
- What decision is needed?
```

---

## Use Case 5: Following Up

The dreaded follow-up email when someone hasn't responded:

### The Prompt Template
```
Write a follow-up email.

Original email topic: [topic]
Sent: [when]
Number of follow-ups already sent: [number]
Urgency level: [low/medium/high]
Relationship: [close/professional/cold]

Goal: Get a response without being annoying.
```

### Follow-Up Progression
```
Follow-up #1 (after 3-5 days): Gentle bump
"Just floating this to the top of your inbox..."

Follow-up #2 (after 1 week): Add value
"I wanted to add [new information] to this..."

Follow-up #3 (after 2 weeks): Direct question
"Is this still a priority? Happy to adjust if not..."

Follow-up #4 (final): Close the loop
"I'll assume we're not moving forward unless I hear back..."
```

---

## Use Case 6: Batch Processing

Handle multiple similar emails at once:

### The Prompt Template
```
I need to respond to these similar requests with
personalized responses. Create a template I can
quickly customize for each:

Request type: [what they're asking for]
Standard response: [what you typically say]
Personalization points: [where to add their name/specifics]
```

---

## Email Power Phrases

Copy-paste starters for common situations:

### Opening Lines
```
Positive: "Great to hear from you..."
Neutral: "Thanks for reaching out..."
Follow-up: "Circling back on..."
Response: "Thanks for the quick reply..."
```

### Transition to Ask
```
Direct: "I'm writing because..."
Soft: "I was hoping you might..."
Collaborative: "I'd love your input on..."
```

### Closing Lines
```
Action needed: "Let me know by [date] if possible."
No action needed: "No response needed - just keeping you in the loop."
Open: "Happy to discuss further if helpful."
Meeting: "Would any of these times work for a quick call?"
```

## Email Speed Run Exercise

Practice by processing these as fast as possible:

**Email 1:** Boss asks for a quick update on your project
**Challenge:** 3 sentences max, includes one blocker and one win

**Email 2:** Client is unhappy with a deliverable
**Challenge:** Acknowledge, don't over-apologize, propose solution

**Email 3:** Someone asks for a favor you can't do
**Challenge:** Decline warmly, suggest alternative

**Email 4:** You need something from a busy executive
**Challenge:** Make the ask clear and easy to answer with "yes"

---

## Your Email System

Build these prompts into your daily workflow:

1. **Morning:** Summarize any long threads
2. **Quick responses:** Use the drafting prompt
3. **Difficult emails:** Use the "help me respond" prompt
4. **Before sending:** Check tone with a quick rewrite
5. **End of day:** Draft any follow-ups needed

**Time saved:** 30-60 minutes per day

## Assignment

1. Find 3 emails sitting in your inbox right now
2. Use AI to draft responses
3. Compare: How long did it take vs. your usual?
4. Save your best prompts for reuse
