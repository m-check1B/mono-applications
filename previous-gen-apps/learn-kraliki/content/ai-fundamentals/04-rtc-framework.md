# The RTC Framework: Role, Task, Context

Welcome to Module 2. This is where you stop being a casual AI user and start becoming a skilled AI communicator.

"Prompt Engineering" sounds like a job for a software engineer.

It's not.

It's a job for a **clear communicator**.

If you get bad results from AI, it's usually because you gave a bad brief. Today, we fix that with a simple framework that works every time.

## The Golden Formula

**Role + Task + Context = Great Results**

That's it. Three elements that transform vague requests into powerful outcomes.

Let's break each one down.

---

## R = Role

The Role tells the AI **who to be**.

When you give AI a role, you're activating specific patterns it learned from experts in that field.

### Without Role:
> "Write about healthy eating."

Result: Generic, bland content that could be from anywhere.

### With Role:
> "You are a nutritionist with 20 years of experience helping busy professionals eat better. Write about healthy eating."

Result: Practical, expert-level advice targeted to the right audience.

### Role Examples

| Role | What It Activates |
|------|------------------|
| "You are a senior software engineer" | Technical precision, code best practices |
| "You are a kindergarten teacher" | Simple language, engaging explanations |
| "You are a strict editor at The Economist" | Formal tone, tight prose |
| "You are a stand-up comedian" | Humor, timing, punch lines |
| "You are a CFO" | Financial perspective, risk awareness |

### Power Roles to Try

```
You are a [profession] with [X years] experience in [specialty].
You are an expert [field] who specializes in [niche].
You are a [role] known for [specific trait or approach].
```

---

## T = Task

The Task tells the AI **what to do**.

Be specific. Very specific.

### Vague Task:
> "Help me with my email."

AI thinks: Help how? Write it? Review it? Shorten it? Translate it?

### Clear Task:
> "Write a professional email declining a meeting invitation. Keep it polite but firm. 3-4 sentences maximum."

AI knows exactly what to produce.

### Task Specifications

Good tasks include:

| Specification | Example |
|--------------|---------|
| **Format** | "Write as bullet points" |
| **Length** | "Keep it under 200 words" |
| **Tone** | "Use a casual, friendly voice" |
| **Structure** | "Include an intro, 3 main points, and a conclusion" |
| **Output type** | "Create a numbered list" / "Write in table format" |

### Task Starters

```
Write... / Draft... / Create...
Summarize... / Explain... / Analyze...
List... / Compare... / Outline...
Review... / Critique... / Improve...
Translate... / Convert... / Reformat...
```

---

## C = Context

Context is the **secret sauce**.

This is where most people fail. They give Role and Task but forget to tell the AI about their specific situation.

### Without Context:
> "You are a marketing expert. Write a product description."

For what product? What audience? What platform? What goal?

### With Context:
> "You are a marketing expert. Write a product description for a noise-canceling headphone aimed at remote workers. It will go on our e-commerce site. The price point is premium ($299). Our brand voice is professional but warm. Competitors focus on tech specs; we focus on work-life balance."

Now the AI can create something tailored, not generic.

### Context Categories

| Category | Example Questions |
|----------|------------------|
| **Audience** | Who will read this? What do they know? What do they need? |
| **Purpose** | What's the goal? What action should readers take? |
| **Constraints** | Word limits? Tone requirements? Things to avoid? |
| **Background** | What led to this? What's the history? |
| **Examples** | What does good look like? What's the style reference? |

## The RTC Template

Here's a template you can copy and adapt:

```
[ROLE]
You are a [profession/expert type] with [experience/specialty].

[TASK]
I need you to [specific action] that [desired outcome].
Format: [bullet points / paragraph / table / etc.]
Length: [word count / number of items]
Tone: [formal / casual / technical / friendly]

[CONTEXT]
Background: [relevant information about the situation]
Audience: [who will use this]
Purpose: [what this is for]
Constraints: [things to include or avoid]
```

---

## Real Example: Before and After

### Before (Bad Prompt):
> "Write a cover letter."

Result: Generic template that could be for anyone, anywhere.

### After (RTC Prompt):

```
[ROLE]
You are a career coach who has helped hundreds of professionals land senior positions at tech companies.

[TASK]
Write a cover letter for a Senior Product Manager position.
- Length: 300-400 words
- Tone: Confident but not arrogant
- Format: 4 paragraphs (hook, experience, fit, close)

[CONTEXT]
- I have 7 years of PM experience, last 3 at a SaaS startup
- The company is Spotify (music streaming)
- The role requires experience with data-driven decisions
- I led a team that increased user retention by 40%
- I'm transitioning from B2B to B2C
- The job posting emphasizes "user empathy" and "cross-functional leadership"
```

Result: A targeted, compelling cover letter that sounds like you, not a template.

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Too vague | Add specific details |
| No role | Give the AI an identity |
| No format specified | Tell it exactly how to structure output |
| No audience mentioned | Say who this is for |
| Assuming AI knows your situation | Explain the context |

## Practice Exercise

Transform these weak prompts into strong RTC prompts:

### Example 1:
**Weak:** "Write an email to my team."
**Strong:** Your turn - add Role, Task, Context.

### Example 2:
**Weak:** "Explain machine learning."
**Strong:** Your turn - add Role, Task, Context.

### Example 3:
**Weak:** "Help me with my presentation."
**Strong:** Your turn - add Role, Task, Context.

## Quick Reference Card

```
R - ROLE
"You are a [expert] who [specialty]..."

T - TASK
"I need you to [action] that is [format/length/tone]..."

C - CONTEXT
"This is for [audience] because [purpose].
Important: [constraints/background]..."
```

## What's Next?

You now have the RTC framework. But what happens when the first response isn't perfect?

In the next lesson, we'll learn about **Iteration and Context** - how to refine AI outputs without starting over, and how to build on previous responses.
