## Compliance Score Calculation

Calculate your overall compliance score:

```
Total Checklist Items: 100
Items Completed: ___
Compliance Percentage: ___%

Status:
90-100%: 🟢 Compliant
70-89%:  🟡 Minor gaps
50-69%:  🟠 Significant gaps
<50%:    🔴 Non-compliant
```

## Next Steps

Based on your compliance score:

**90-100%:** Maintain compliance, monitor for changes
**70-89%:** Address gaps within 30 days
**50-69%:** Priority action plan required
**<50%:** Immediate engagement with compliance experts
