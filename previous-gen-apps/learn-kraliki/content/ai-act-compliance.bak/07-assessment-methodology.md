# Verduona Assessment Methodology

## Our Approach

Verduona provides a **practical, implementation-focused** approach to AI Act compliance. Unlike Big 4 consulting firms that focus on theory, we deliver actionable steps you can implement immediately.

## The Verduona Compliance Framework

### Phase 1: Discovery (Day 1)

#### AI System Inventory
- List all AI systems in use
- Classify by risk category (prohibited, high-risk, limited, minimal)
- Map systems to business processes
- Identify data flows

#### Risk Assessment
- Evaluate each AI system against risk criteria
- Document potential impacts
- Prioritize compliance efforts

**Output:** Complete AI inventory and risk matrix

### Phase 2: Gap Analysis (Day 1-2)

#### Requirements Mapping
For each high-risk AI system:
- Map against 10 mandatory requirements
- Identify what's already in place
- Document gaps

#### Priority Scoring
| Factor | Score (1-5) |
|--------|-------------|
| Regulatory deadline urgency | - |
| Business criticality | - |
| Implementation complexity | - |
| Resource requirements | - |
| Risk level | - |

**Output:** Prioritized compliance roadmap

### Phase 3: Control Implementation (Months 1-6)
