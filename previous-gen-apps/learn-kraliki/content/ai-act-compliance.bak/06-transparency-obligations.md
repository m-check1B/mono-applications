# Transparency Obligations

## Overview

Transparency obligations apply to **limited-risk AI systems**. Unlike high-risk AI, these systems don't require prior approval, but they **must be clearly labeled** so users know they're interacting with AI.

## What Requires Transparency

### 1. Chatbots and Virtual Assistants

**Requirement:** Users must be informed they're interacting with AI

**Implementation:**
- Clear disclosure at conversation start
- Visible AI indicator
- Option to speak to human operator
- No human impersonation

**Example Disclosure:**
> "You are speaking with an AI assistant. I can help with information and support, but for complex matters, I can connect you with a human agent."

### 2. AI-Generated Content (Deepfakes)

**Requirement:** AI-generated or manipulated content must be disclosed

**What to Label:**
- Synthetic videos and images
- AI-generated text articles
- Voice synthesis
- Music generation
- Image manipulation (deepfakes)

**Labeling Approaches:**
- Watermarks on content
- Metadata tags
- Visible disclaimers
- Platform-level indicators

**Examples:**
```markdown
# Image Caption
"AI-generated portrait - created using Stable Diffusion"

# Video Label
"This video contains AI-generated content"

# Audio Warning
"Voice synthesized using AI technology"
```

### 3. Emotion Recognition Systems

**Requirement:** Users must be informed when being analyzed

**Applicable Contexts:**
- Customer service analytics
- Marketing research
- User experience testing
- Behavioral studies

**NOT Allowed:** Workplace or education use (prohibited)

**Implementation:**
- Pre-session disclosure
- Clear consent mechanism
- Opt-out options
- Data retention policies

### 4. Biometric Categorization

**Requirement:** Inform users when their biometric data is categorized

**Categories (Unless Prohibited):**
- Age estimation
- Gender classification
- Facial feature analysis
- Voice characteristic analysis

**Transparency Steps:**
1. Disclose before processing
2. Explain categorization purpose
3. Provide data rights information
4. Offer opt-out alternatives

## Practical Implementation

### Website Bots

```html
<div class="ai-disclaimer">
  <span class="ai-icon">🤖</span>
  <p>This chatbot uses AI. For urgent issues, contact support directly.</p>
</div>
```

### Social Media Posts

## Consent Requirements

### When Consent is Needed

- **Explicit consent**: For processing sensitive biometric data
- **Informed consent**: Users must understand what's happening
- **Active consent**: Not buried in terms of service

### Consent Best Practices

✅ Clear, plain language
✅ Separate from other agreements
✅ Easy to understand
✅ Easy to withdraw
✅ Specific to AI use

❌ Buried in fine print
❌ Bundled with other consents
❌ Legal jargon
❌ Difficult to opt-out
❌ Vague "we may use AI" language

## User Rights

Under transparency obligations, users have the right to:

1. **Know** they're interacting with AI
2. **Understand** what the AI is doing
3. **Opt-out** of AI features when possible
4. **Access** human alternatives
5. **Review** AI decisions affecting them
6. **Contest** AI outputs

## Documentation Requirements

Maintain records of:
- AI systems deployed
- Transparency mechanisms used
- User disclosures provided
- Consents obtained
- Opt-out statistics
- User feedback

## Compliance Checklist

For each AI system with transparency obligations:

- [ ] AI disclosure prominently displayed
- [ ] Users can opt-out when feasible
- [ ] Human alternative available (if applicable)
- [ ] Clear consent mechanism (if required)
- [ ] Documentation of disclosure process
- [ ] Regular review of transparency measures

## Enforcement

### Penalties for Non-Compliance

- **Up to €30 million** or 6% of global revenue
- **Product recall** required
- **Public notification** of violation

### Common Violations

- Failing to disclose AI use
- Impersonating human operators
- Misrepresenting AI capabilities
- Using AI without consent for sensitive data
- Not providing opt-out options

## Best Practices

### 1. Be Proactive
- Disclose before user engagement
- Make transparency visible, not hidden
- Educate users about AI limitations

### 2. Be Clear
- Use simple language
- Avoid technical jargon
- Provide specific AI capabilities

### 3. Be Honest
- Don't overstate AI capabilities
- Acknowledge AI limitations
- Report AI errors honestly

### 4. Be Accessible
- Provide human alternatives
- Make opt-out easy
- Offer multiple contact methods
