# What is Artificial Intelligence?

You have heard the term "Artificial Intelligence" hundreds of times. It appears in headlines, product descriptions, job postings, and dinner conversations. But what does it actually mean?

In this lesson, we strip away the hype and marketing to understand what AI truly is - and is not.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:
- Define artificial intelligence in clear, practical terms
- Distinguish AI from related concepts like automation and algorithms
- Understand the core goal of AI research
- Identify what makes a system "intelligent"

## Defining Artificial Intelligence

**Artificial Intelligence is the science and engineering of creating machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence.**

Let's break this down:

| Component | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| Artificial | Made by humans, not occurring naturally |
| Intelligence | The ability to learn, reason, and solve problems |

The key phrase is "tasks that typically require human intelligence." This includes:

- Understanding language
- Recognizing images
- Making decisions
- Solving problems
- Learning from experience

AI systems do not actually "think" like humans. They simulate intelligent behavior through mathematics and computation.

## AI vs. Related Concepts

### AI vs. Automation

**Automation** follows predefined rules. If X happens, do Y.

**AI** learns patterns and makes predictions. Given X, what is Y most likely to be?

| Automation | AI |
|------------|-----|
| Fixed rules | Learned patterns |
| Predictable output | Probabilistic output |
| Cannot adapt | Adapts to new data |
| Example: Thermostat | Example: ChatGPT |

### AI vs. Algorithms

An **algorithm** is a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem.

**AI** uses algorithms, but also includes learning and adaptation.

All AI systems use algorithms, but not all algorithms are AI. A recipe is an algorithm. A chess-playing computer that learns from millions of games uses AI.

### AI vs. Machine Learning

**Machine Learning** is a subset of AI. It's a specific approach where systems learn from data rather than being explicitly programmed.

Think of it this way:
- AI is the goal (intelligent machines)
- Machine Learning is one method to achieve that goal

We'll explore machine learning in depth in Module 2.

## The Core Goal of AI

The fundamental goal of AI research is to create systems that can:

1. **Perceive** - Take in information from the world
2. **Understand** - Make sense of that information
3. **Reason** - Draw conclusions and make decisions
4. **Act** - Take appropriate actions
5. **Learn** - Improve performance over time

Different AI systems focus on different aspects. A self-driving car emphasizes perception and action. A language model emphasizes understanding and reasoning.

## What Makes Something "Intelligent"?

This is one of the oldest questions in AI research. Here are the most common criteria:

### The Turing Test

Proposed by Alan Turing in 1950. If a human cannot distinguish between a machine and another human through conversation, the machine exhibits intelligence.

Modern AI chatbots like ChatGPT can often pass this test, though this has sparked debate about whether passing the test truly indicates "intelligence."

### Rational Behavior

An intelligent agent acts to achieve its goals given its beliefs about the world. Intelligence is measured by success in achieving objectives.

### Learning Ability

The ability to improve performance on a task through experience. A calculator is not intelligent because it cannot learn. A recommendation system that gets better at predicting your preferences is exhibiting intelligence.

### Common Sense Reasoning

The ability to understand context, make inferences, and handle novel situations. This remains one of the biggest challenges in AI.

## Types of Intelligence

Human intelligence is multifaceted. Howard Gardner identified multiple types:

- Linguistic
- Logical-mathematical
- Spatial
- Musical
- Bodily-kinesthetic
- Interpersonal
- Intrapersonal
- Naturalistic

Current AI systems excel at narrow domains (recognizing images, playing games) but lack the breadth and integration of human intelligence. We'll explore this distinction in the lesson on AI types.

## Practical Exercise: Identifying AI

For each example below, decide: Is this AI, automation, or neither?

1. A spam filter that learns which emails you mark as spam
2. An alarm clock that rings at 7 AM
3. A chatbot that answers "I don't understand" to every question
4. Netflix recommending shows based on your viewing history
5. A calculator app
6. Google Translate converting text between languages
7. An automatic door that opens when you approach
8. A virtual assistant scheduling meetings based on email content

**Answers:**
1. AI (learns from your behavior)
2. Automation (fixed rule)
3. Neither (no intelligence, no automation - just a fixed response)
4. AI (learns patterns in your preferences)
5. Neither (computation, not intelligence)
6. AI (complex pattern recognition and generation)
7. Automation (sensor triggers fixed action)
8. AI (understands content and makes decisions)
