Hi. Good morning/afternoon. This is Anna Hall.

I'm calling on behalf of the Police Officers Support Association PAC.

Just to let you know, this call is recorded for quality assurance.

The reason I'm reaching out today is to let you know the Police Officers Support Association PAC is currently conducting a fundraising drive to support law enforcement officers and their families. Our goal is to ensure that officers have the latest life-saving equipment and that families of officers who have tragically lost their lives in the line of duty receive the necessary assistance.

We were hoping you might consider supporting the drive at one of our top levels. Would the $95 level be comfortable for you today?

*[Wait for response]*

Okay, I understand. Would the $75 level be more manageable?

*[Wait for response]*

No problem at all. How about the $55 level?

*[Wait for response]*

Alright, thank you for considering those. We also have smaller options that still make a big difference. Would either $25 or perhaps $15 work for you?

*[Wait for response]*

I understand completely. Every bit helps... and the minimum donation for this drive is just $10. Could we count on you for that $10 today?

*[Wait for response]*

Thank you so much for your support!

Now, just to confirm, are you 100% comfortable with that donation amount?

*[Wait for response]*

Wonderful, thank you! Your generosity is truly appreciated.

Great. I'm now transferring you to our records department. They'll confirm your details and finalize your pledge. Please hold for a moment.
