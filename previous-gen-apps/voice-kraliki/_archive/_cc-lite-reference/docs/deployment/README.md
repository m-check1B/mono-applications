# Deployment Guides

- [Deployment Runbook](./DEPLOYMENT.md): Step-by-step procedures for rolling out updates.
- [Production Deployment Guide](./PRODUCTION_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md): Hardened checklist for 24/7 workloads.
- [Production Readiness Assessment](./production-readiness-assessment.md): Audit results and gating criteria.
- [Infrastructure Analysis](./INFRASTRUCTURE_DEPLOYMENT_ANALYSIS.md): Deep dive into container topology and hosting strategy.

Container orchestration is standardised on `infra/docker/production.yml`. Update these docs whenever the compose file or hosting strategy changes.
