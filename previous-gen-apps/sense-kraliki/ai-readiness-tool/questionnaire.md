## Question Design Notes

### Scoring Philosophy
- Each question is 1-5 scale for consistency
- Neutral language, no leading questions
- Answers progress from less mature to more mature
- Questions are specific enough to be actionable
- Balance between aspiration and reality

### Skip Logic (for digital implementation)
- If Q4.1 = 1 (< $10K budget), show different recommendations
- If Q2.4 = 5 (ML team exists), skip basic recommendations
- If Q5.5 = 1-2 (no KPIs), emphasize measurement first

### A/B Testing Candidates
- Short version (15 questions) vs. full version (25)
- With/without industry benchmarks
- Immediate results vs. email-only delivery
