## What L2 Organizations Typically Experience

- "We've tried ChatGPT but aren't sure how to apply it systematically"
- "Our data is in cloud tools but not well connected"
- "Leadership is interested but wants to see proof before investing"
- "We know there are opportunities but need help prioritizing"
- "Some team members are excited, others are skeptical"

This is the "awareness-action gap" - and it's where most organizations get stuck.
