## Build vs. Buy Decision Framework

At L3, this question becomes critical:

| Factor | Build | Buy |
|--------|-------|-----|
| Unique business process | Consider | Less suitable |
| Competitive differentiator | Prefer | Avoid |
| Standard workflow | Avoid | Prefer |
| In-house AI skills | Required | Not required |
| Time to value | Slower | Faster |
| Long-term cost | Lower (maybe) | Predictable |
| Flexibility | Maximum | Limited |

**Our Recommendation:** Start with buy/integrate, build only for true differentiation.

## Common L3 Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Over-customizing** - Building when buying would be faster
2. **Underestimating change management** - Tech works, adoption fails
3. **Siloed implementations** - Each team does their own thing
4. **No governance** - Proliferation of tools and approaches
5. **Measuring activity, not outcomes** - "We implemented 5 AI tools" vs. "We saved X hours"
